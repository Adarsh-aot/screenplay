**FADE IN**

---

### Scene 1  
**Location**: Victor Reese’s Mansion - Study (Night)

*The study is dimly lit, ominous shadows dancing across the walls. Blood is splattered across the polished hardwood floor, and Victor Reese’s body lies sprawled, lifeless, in a pool of blood.*

**Detective Marcus Hale**: (Examining the body, calm but intense) Whoever did this... they weren’t just angry. They were furious.

**Assistant Maya Lane**: (Looking around, a notebook in hand) And they wanted him to know it. (Pauses) This room feels... haunted.

**Marcus**: (Slightly sarcastic) All crime scenes are haunted, Maya. The real question is, who was angry enough to haunt it?

**Maya**: (Glancing at Victor's body) Considering what we’ve heard about him, who wasn’t?

**Marcus**: (Nods) Let's start rounding them up. Each one probably has a story worth hearing.

---

### Scene 2  
**Location**: Mansion - Living Room (Day)

*The suspects sit scattered, uneasy, casting wary glances at one another as Detective Hale stands in front of them.*

**Marcus**: (Surveying them) Let’s keep this simple. Who was the last person to see Victor alive?

**Emma Reese**: (Coldly) I was. We argued. He had... made some poor choices. But you won’t find me grieving over him.

**Oliver Grayson**: (Scoffs, crossing his arms) “Poor choices”? That’s rich coming from the one who married him. We all know why.

**Lucas Trent**: (Aggressive) Don’t even start, Oliver. At least she had the guts to admit she didn’t care.

**James Rivers**: (Leans forward, voice laced with bitterness) I can’t say I cared much either. The man ruined lives. My life.

**Marcus**: (Noting each reaction carefully) Seems like Mr. Reese wasn’t exactly loved.

**Henry Gale**: (Nervously) Detective, people like Victor… they thrive on conflict. He loved making enemies.

---

### Scene 3  
**Location**: Mansion - Kitchen (Day) - Interview with Emma

*Emma sits at the kitchen table, her hands resting calmly on a cup of tea. Maya observes, arms crossed.*

**Emma**: (Glancing out the window) I won’t pretend, Detective. I didn’t love him, and he didn’t love me. We had an… understanding.

**Maya**: (Raising an eyebrow) An understanding that led to murder?

**Emma**: (Laughs coldly) If I’d wanted him dead, you’d never find the body. I’ve thought about it plenty.

**Marcus**: (Steady) Thought about it? When did those thoughts get serious?

**Emma**: (Shrugs) He was manipulative, Detective. He got under your skin. But murder? That’s messy.

**Maya**: (Not buying it) Did he know how you felt?

**Emma**: (Stiffens slightly) He thrived on knowing.

---

### Scene 4  
**Location**: Mansion - Study (Day) - Interview with Oliver

*Oliver shifts uneasily as he stands in the study, glancing nervously around the room.*

**Oliver**: (Bitterly) We built the business together, and he threw me aside like trash.

**Marcus**: (Watching him carefully) Sounds like a solid motive, Oliver.

**Oliver**: (Glances sharply at Marcus) Motive? Maybe. But if I wanted him dead, I’d have made it quick. This… this was torture.

**Maya**: (Jots down notes) So you’re saying you wouldn’t have left a mess?

**Oliver**: (Exhales) I’m saying I wanted him to suffer, but not like this. There’s a difference.

**Marcus**: (Cocking his head) You’re awfully precise about the kind of pain you’d inflict.

**Oliver**: (Shrugs) Call it honesty, Detective.

---

### Scene 5  
**Location**: Mansion - Library (Day) - Interview with Lucas

*Lucas clenches his fists, his jaw tight, as he faces Marcus and Maya in the library.*

**Lucas**: (Through gritted teeth) He took everything that mattered from me. My inheritance, my dignity.

**Marcus**: (Calmly) Sounds like revenge was on your mind, Lucas.

**Lucas**: (Bitter laugh) Revenge? I wanted justice. But Victor—he didn’t care about justice.

**Maya**: (Curious) Justice... your way?

**Lucas**: (Leans in) The world would be better off without him. But I didn’t kill him, if that’s what you’re implying.

**Marcus**: (Meets Lucas’ eyes) Did you know he was planning to cut you off entirely?

**Lucas**: (Silent for a moment, then smirks) Typical. He never thought anyone would stand up to him.

---

### Scene 6  
**Location**: Mansion - Garden (Day) - Interview with Jared

*Jared stands under a cold, grey sky, the wind ruffling his coat as Marcus and Maya approach him.*

**Marcus**: (Hands in pockets) You were close, Jared. Childhood friends. And yet you’re here, like the rest.

**Jared**: (Tight smile) We were close. But that was before he started playing God with people’s lives.

**Maya**: (Curious) Playing God? That’s a strong accusation.

**Jared**: (Intense) He knew I was drowning in debt, and he held it over me like a knife. Never let me forget.

**Marcus**: (Leaning forward) A knife you wanted to use on him instead?

**Jared**: (Steps back) I… I wanted him out of my life. That doesn’t mean I’d kill him.

**Maya**: (Writing) You sound unsure, Jared.

**Jared**: (Defensive) Look, I hated the man. But murder? That’s… that’s different.

---

### Scene 7  
**Location**: Mansion - Basement (Day) - Interview with Ethan

*Ethan sits on a crate, his hands folded, looking stoic as Marcus and Maya approach him.*

**Marcus**: (Crossing his arms) You’ve worked here the longest, Ethan. Known him better than anyone.

**Ethan**: (Without emotion) I knew him well enough to know he deserved what he got.

**Maya**: (Intrigued) Deserved it? Why?

**Ethan**: (Gazes down) Let’s just say he was a collector of secrets. And he never cared how they hurt people.

**Marcus**: (Pushing) Any secret of yours?

**Ethan**: (Glances up) We all have our secrets, Detective. Victor knew too many of them.

**Maya**: (Slightly unnerved) Are you saying he knew enough to get himself killed?

**Ethan**: (Calm) I’m saying he should have expected it.

---

### Scene 8  
**Location**: Mansion - Hallway (Day) - Discussion between Marcus and Maya

*Maya and Marcus walk down a dimly lit hallway, talking quietly.*

**Maya**: (Thoughtfully) They all had reasons. Every single one of them.

**Marcus**: (Grimly) That’s what bothers me. It’s too clean, too… orchestrated.

**Maya**: (Pauses) Orchestrated?

**Marcus**: (Nods) Like someone planned it. Like they all knew what was coming.

**Maya**: (Shivers slightly) You think one of them planted this idea in the others?

**Marcus**: (Nods slowly) Or, someone made it easy for them to hate him. Someone who wanted him gone… without lifting a finger.

---

### Scene 9  
**Location**: Mansion - Living Room (Night) - Confrontation

*All suspects are gathered again. Tension is thick as Marcus begins the final round of questioning.*

**Marcus**: (To everyone) One of you knows more than you’re letting on. This wasn’t a simple murder.

**Emma**: (Scoffs) Nothing about Victor was ever simple.

**Lucas**: (Defensive) Are you accusing all of us, Detective?

**Marcus**: (Coldly) I’m saying one of you

 engineered this. I’m just waiting for the truth to slip.

**Henry**: (Panicked) What are you implying?

**Marcus**: (Meets each suspect’s eyes) That all of you had the motive... but only one had the patience.

---
---

### Scene 10  
**Location**: Mansion - Study (Night) - Private Conversation between Marcus and Maya

*The room is dimly lit, casting eerie shadows. Marcus sits across from Maya at Victor’s desk, reviewing his notes.*

**Marcus**: (Sighs, rubbing his temples) We’re going in circles, Maya. Each of them has a motive, a confession even, but none of it lines up.

**Maya**: (Thoughtfully) It’s almost like they each wanted to be a suspect, but not the killer.

**Marcus**: (Pauses, realizing something) Or someone wanted them all to look guilty.

**Maya**: (Eyes widen) You think someone manipulated them? Used their hatred to frame them?

**Marcus**: (Nods) If that’s true, this was a meticulous setup. Whoever did this knew Victor—and his enemies—well.

**Maya**: (Leaning forward, whispering) Then we’re not dealing with just a killer. We’re dealing with a mastermind.

---

### Scene 11  
**Location**: Mansion - Guest Bedroom (Night) - Interview with James Rivers

*James sits on the edge of the bed, tense, his eyes darting around the room.*

**Marcus**: (Leaning against the door) Victor fired you five years ago, didn’t he? Claimed you “betrayed” him.

**James**: (Bitterly) Betrayed? He ruined my career! Made sure I’d never work in finance again.

**Maya**: (Gently) That’s a strong grievance, James. Enough to hold a grudge?

**James**: (Defensive) I hated him, yes. But I didn’t kill him. If I wanted revenge, I’d have made it public.

**Marcus**: (Intrigued) Public? Sounds like you had dirt on him.

**James**: (Hesitates, then nods) Enough to ruin him. But I never got the chance. He… destroyed everything.

**Maya**: (Skeptical) Yet, here you are, back in his house. Strange, don’t you think?

**James**: (Eyes darken) Maybe. But I didn’t pull that trigger.

---

### Scene 12  
**Location**: Mansion - Garden Shed (Night) - Confrontation with Oliver

*Marcus and Maya find Oliver in the garden shed, rummaging through tools. He freezes as they enter.*

**Marcus**: (Coldly) You seem jumpy, Oliver. Something we should know?

**Oliver**: (Visibly rattled) I… I just needed some air. This whole thing’s a nightmare.

**Maya**: (Steps closer) Or perhaps it’s a convenient opportunity?

**Oliver**: (Backing away) What are you implying?

**Marcus**: (Firmly) You hated Victor for cutting you out. You said it yourself. You wanted him to suffer.

**Oliver**: (Desperate) Yes, I hated him! But I couldn’t have done it. I don’t have it in me.

**Maya**: (Voice low) Maybe you didn’t, but someone here does.

**Oliver**: (Whispers, trembling) I… I saw someone that night, by the study. But I didn’t say anything.

**Marcus**: (Eyes narrowing) Who, Oliver? Who did you see?

**Oliver**: (Swallows hard) Emma. She was there, looking… different.

---

### Scene 13  
**Location**: Mansion - Hallway (Night) - Conversation with Emma

*Emma walks briskly down the hallway, but Marcus intercepts her.*

**Marcus**: (Blocking her path) Oliver says he saw you near the study that night.

**Emma**: (Unfazed) So? This is my home. I can walk wherever I want.

**Maya**: (Suspiciously) You weren’t there to see Victor, were you?

**Emma**: (Smirking) What do you think, Detective? We hadn’t spoken in days. I was… enjoying a quiet night alone.

**Marcus**: (Firmly) This isn’t a game, Emma. Every story you give us changes.

**Emma**: (Pauses, looks Marcus in the eyes) Victor hurt people. If you want a confession, you’ll have to look harder than that.

**Maya**: (To Marcus, quietly) She’s hiding something. I can feel it.

---

### Scene 14  
**Location**: Mansion - Study (Night) - Marcus and Maya Review Evidence

*Marcus and Maya sit at the desk, reviewing their notes, frustration mounting.*

**Maya**: (Rubbing her temples) This feels like a web, and every thread leads back to someone with a reason to want him dead.

**Marcus**: (Nods, thinking aloud) Lucas, the brother who lost his inheritance. Jared, who was in debt. James, with his ruined career. And Emma… she has something she’s not telling us.

**Maya**: (Realizing) It’s like Victor was a magnet for hate. Every person in his life had a reason to want him gone.

**Marcus**: (Suddenly) Wait. What if that’s what the killer wanted? For each one of them to look guilty?

**Maya**: (Eyes widen) Are you saying… a setup?

**Marcus**: (Nods) But to what end? That’s what we have to find out.

---

### Scene 15  
**Location**: Mansion - Wine Cellar (Night) - Confrontation with Henry Gale

*Henry sits in the wine cellar, nervously clutching a glass. Marcus and Maya approach him.*

**Marcus**: (Firmly) Henry, why did Victor have you blacklisted?

**Henry**: (Shaken) He… he found out I was investigating him. His connections, his past deals. He was corrupt, Detective.

**Maya**: (Pressing) And he threatened you?

**Henry**: (Nods, defeated) He told me if I ever published, he’d destroy me. And he did. I lost everything.

**Marcus**: (Intensely) So when you saw your chance to end him, you took it?

**Henry**: (Desperate) No! I thought about it, yes. But someone got to him before I did.

**Maya**: (Suspiciously) Convenient story, Henry.

**Henry**: (Clutching his head) You don’t understand. We all hated him. But only one of us could hate him enough to do this.

---

### Scene 16  
**Location**: Mansion - Dining Room (Morning) - Final Roundtable of Suspects

*All suspects are gathered around a large dining table, tension thick in the air as Marcus and Maya enter.*

**Marcus**: (Standing at the head of the table) We’re almost done here. But I need each of you to tell us one last thing: why did you stay? Why come here tonight?

**Emma**: (Smirking) Curiosity, I suppose. Wanted to see how far you’d get.

**Oliver**: (Avoids eye contact) Some part of me needed closure. Even if he was a monster, he was still my partner.

**Lucas**: (Scoffs) Don’t pretend you’re mourning him, Oliver. We’re all here because we wanted something from him. And now, maybe we’ll get it.

**James**: (Defensive) I wanted my revenge, yes. But murder? That’s a step too far.

**Jared**: (Softly) Debt isn’t something you can just erase. But… maybe he deserved this.

**Henry**: (Bitterly) Victor controlled us all. And some of us needed him gone more than others.

**Maya**: (Leans over to Marcus, whispering) They’re all close to confessing.

**Marcus**: (Nods, addressing the group) Interesting stories. But one of you is hiding the truth. And I think I know who.

---

### Scene 17  
**Location**: Mansion - Upstairs Hallway (Morning) - Private Confession

*Emma approaches Marcus in the hallway, a sly smile on her face.*

**Emma**: (Quietly) You know, Detective, Victor wasn’t the only one with secrets. You’ve been asking questions… but not the right ones.

**Marcus**: (Curious) Is that so? Then enlighten me, Emma.

**Emma**: (Leans in close) Let’s just say, if I wanted Victor dead, I’d make sure everyone thought someone else did it.

**Marcus**: (Eyes narrow) You’re saying this was your plan?

**Emma**: (Smiles) I’m saying you should look closer at what he’s left behind. You’ll find what you’re looking for.

---

### Scene 18  
**Location**: Mansion - Library (Day) - Marcus Confronts Lucas

*Lucas sits in the library, looking haunted. Marcus enters, shutting the door behind him.*

**Marcus**: (Directly) Lucas, I think you’re hiding something. Something only a brother would know.

**Lucas**: (Defensive) What are you talking about?

**Marcus**: (Coldly) Your father’s name. Victor buried it under layers of deceit, didn’t he?

**Lucas**: (Angry) That’s none of your business.

**Marcus**: (Steps closer) It is if it was the reason you killed him.

**Lucas**: (Pauses, then smirks) Maybe I did hate him enough to kill him. But did I? Guess you’ll never know.

---

### Scene 19  
**Location**: Mansion - Study (Day) - Final Revelation

*Marcus and Maya gather all suspects in the study, tension high.*

**Marcus**: (To everyone) This investigation has revealed your secrets, your motives. But there’s one secret none of you could hide.

**Maya**: (Reading from her notes) Each of you confessed your hatred, but only one person showed no fear in his actions.

**Marcus**: (Points to Lucas) Lucas, you orchestrated this. You fed on their hatred to mask your revenge. Admit it.

**Lucas**: (Laughs) Victor destroyed my family. So, yes, I played my part. But it wasn’t murder, Detective. It was justice.

**Emma**: (Shocked) You used us all.

**Lucas**: (Coldly) Victor was a parasite. You wanted him dead as much as I did. You should be thanking me.

**Marcus**: (Grimly) Justice? You’ll see it—behind bars.

---

### Scene 20  
**Location**: Mansion - Outside (Day) - Police Escort

*Lucas is led out in handcuffs, defiant yet satisfied. The suspects watch, a mixture of relief and horror.*

**Marcus**: (To Maya) Case closed. Though, I’d hardly call this justice.

**Maya**: (Nods solemnly) Revenge masquerading as justice. In the end, they’re just different words for hate.

**Marcus**: (Turns away) Let’s go. This house has had enough ghosts.

---

**FADE OUT**
