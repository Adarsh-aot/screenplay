### Scene 1
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - UNKNOWN LOCATION - MORNING**

*Eight strangers wake up in a dimly lit, claustrophobic room. Rusty chains dangle from the walls, and a single flickering lightbulb casts eerie shadows over their confused faces. The air is cold and damp.*

**Hacker:** (disoriented, clutching his head) Where... where are we?

**Nurse:** (blinking, trying to focus) I... I don’t remember... I was just at work...

**Developer:** (scanning the room, unimpressed) This some kind of twisted joke?

*A crackling sound echoes through the room as an unseen **Voice on Speaker** interrupts them, deep and distorted.*

**Voice on Speaker:** *You are here because each of you hides a truth. If you wish to leave, you must confess.*

*The group looks around nervously. A few snicker, but their laughter fades when no one else joins in.*

**Detective:** (nervous but defiant) Alright, who’s behind this? I’m not falling for it.

**DR Emily:** (shivers, whispering) No... this doesn’t feel like a joke.

*A chilling silence fills the room as the reality of the situation begins to sink in. Each one glances at the others, uncertain and wary.*

---

### Scene 2
*Suddenly, a small pedestal in the center of the room lights up, illuminating a blood-red envelope sitting on it. The group stares, hesitant.*

**Hacker:** (eyeing the envelope, his face paling) That... looks like a data packet. It... it reminds me of something I’d rather forget.

**Driver:** (narrowing his eyes) What’s that supposed to mean? You hiding something?

**Hacker:** (sighs, looking down) Fine. Years back, I tried to blackmail someone. I thought I deleted everything, but... (hesitates) maybe I didn’t.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*A faint unlocking sound echoes, but the door remains locked. A palpable tension thickens the air.*

---

### Scene 3
*Another blood-red envelope appears, as if taunting them. **The Developer** picks it up with a cold, calculating smirk.*

**Developer:** (holding up an old ID card) Recognize her? She was an intern. I bullied her, pushed her until she broke. Forced her out.

**Nurse:** (appalled) How can you be so heartless?

**Developer:** (shrugs, indifferent) I don’t care. It’s just who I am.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The room seems to vibrate slightly, the walls closing in as if acknowledging their sins.*

---

### Scene 4
*A hospital attendance chart materializes. **Doctor** and **Nurse** exchange a glance, both visibly shaken.*

**Doctor:** (clutching the chart, his voice low) We ignored her calls that night... went home early. She didn’t make it because we weren’t there.

**Driver:** (angrily) Aren’t you supposed to save lives?

**Doctor:** (ashamed) I was... careless. I... I’m sorry.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*Everyone shivers as the guilt settles heavily on them, realizing there’s no escape from their past.*

---

### Scene 5
*A case file marked “CLOSED” appears next. The **Detective** hesitates, then picks it up.*

**Detective:** (grimacing) Took a bribe to call this case an accident. Said it was... nobody’s fault.

**DR Emily:** (staring him down) You sold her justice for money?

**Detective:** (quietly) I did. (pauses) And I can’t undo it.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The door groans but remains closed, as if mocking their attempts to escape.*

---

### Scene 6
*A cracked car mirror materializes. **Driver** goes pale, his hands trembling as he recognizes it.*

**Driver:** (voice shaking) I... I hit her with my car. (pauses) I left her there. Just... drove off.

**Priest:** (disbelief) You left her to die?

**Driver:** (whispers) I was scared. Didn’t want to face it...

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The others look away, each haunted by their own guilt as the air grows colder, more oppressive.*

---

### Scene 7
*A frayed piece of cloth appears next, worn and faded. **Priest** stares at it, visibly disturbed.*

**Priest:** I saw her lying there... I could’ve helped, but... I told myself it wasn’t my duty. I was... afraid.

**Doctor:** (incredulous) You’re a priest! How could you turn your back?

**Priest:** (voice breaking) I was afraid of what it would mean... what I would have to face.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The room feels tighter, as if their sins are physically closing in on them.*

---

### Scene 8
*A brightly decorated notebook with childlike doodles appears. **DR Emily** picks it up, her expression a mixture of sorrow and fury.*

**DR Emily:** (whispering) This was my daughter’s. She needed me, but I was too distracted... too wrapped up in my own life.

**Hacker:** (softly) She... was she...?

**DR Emily:** (nods, trembling) She’s the one each of you hurt. You all played a part.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The door groans, a chilling sound echoing through the silence. Yet, it remains firmly shut.*

---

### Scene 9
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

*Another red envelope appears, bearing a school report card. **Nurse** takes it with shaky hands.*

**Nurse:** (whispers) She tried so hard... wanted to make her mom proud. But I dismissed her that night, told her I didn’t have time.

**Doctor:** (softly) Just another patient to us, wasn’t she?

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The silence grows heavy, each person’s breathing loud and panicked.*

---

### Scene 10
*An envelope marked "CASE CLOSED" appears. **Detective** looks down, shame filling his face.*

**Detective:** I took money from the hospital... claimed her case was an accident. Erased her from the records.

**Driver:** (furious) You erased her truth.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The oppressive silence returns, each confession pulling them deeper into the weight of their sins.*

---

### Scene 11
*A cracked mirror appears. **Driver** recognizes it, clutching it in fear.*

**Driver:** I was the one who... who hit her. Didn’t stop to help. I... I was a coward.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The room seems darker, the dim light barely illuminating their faces.*

---

### Scene 12
*A rosary appears, the **Priest** gripping it tightly.*

**Priest:** (voice trembling) I told myself it wasn’t my problem. I let my fear overtake my duty.

**DR Emily:** (venomously) You had the power to help, and you chose to look away.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*Each one is left with a sense of dread as they confront their guilt.*

---

### Scene 13
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - LATER**

*A tiny, colorful book decorated with stickers appears, its cover worn and faded. **DR Emily** picks it up with trembling hands, her face filled with sorrow and barely concealed rage.*

**DR Emily:** (whispering) This was hers... My daughter’s. She poured her little heart into this, her dreams, her joys... and her pain. But none of you cared.

**Hacker:** (nervously) She was... she was just a kid?

**DR Emily:** (broken, voice cracking) Yes. You all took her piece by piece, choice by choice. She was just a child. And now she's gone.

*The group collectively flinches, haunted by the enormity of their guilt.*

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The room grows colder, the dim light flickering as if the darkness is closing in. The group looks around, each person feeling the weight of their actions pressing down.*

---

### Scene 14
*The last object appears—a delicate, bloodstained piece of torn fabric. Everyone falls silent as they stare at it, recognizing it as a part of the young girl's dress.*

**DR Emily:** (holding the fabric, her voice like ice) This was the dress she wore the night she was taken from me... taken from life. (pauses, looking each person in the eye) And each of you played a part.

**Priest:** (voice trembling) We failed her... all of us, didn’t we?

**Developer:** (softly, almost in shock) We could have changed things… could have stopped this from happening.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Final confession. All parts unlocked.*

*A loud, echoing click signals the unlocking of the door. It swings open slowly, revealing only darkness beyond—a corridor stretching into nothingness.*

---

### Scene 15
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

*The group stands at the threshold, hesitant and deeply shaken. No one moves. **DR Emily** stands at the center, cold and unyielding.*

**DR Emily:** (staring each of them down) Do you understand now? I brought you here to face yourselves, to feel every ounce of pain you caused her… and me.

**Detective:** (in a hushed voice) You... you set this up?

**DR Emily:** Yes. I needed each of you to see yourselves for what you really are. (pauses, her voice chilling) This was her justice.

*The group members look at each other, horrified and remorseful. The open door beckons them, yet they seem frozen with dread.*

**Voice on Speaker:** *Final confession. The judgment is complete.*

*The door creaks, almost as if mocking them, opening further into the abyss.*

---

### Scene 16
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - OPEN DOORWAY**

*One by one, the group members step toward the doorway, each carrying a haunted expression as they approach the darkness beyond. The **Detective** pauses, glancing back at **DR Emily**.*

**Detective:** (barely audible) Will we ever really leave this room? Or will this follow us?

**DR Emily:** (coldly) She will never leave me. (her gaze hardens) Now, she will never leave any of you.

*Each member takes a final, somber glance at **DR Emily**, knowing their lives will never be the same.*

*One by one, they disappear into the darkness of the hallway beyond, their footsteps fading into silence.*

---

### Scene 17
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - EMPTY - MOMENTS LATER**

*The door stands ajar, casting a faint light that barely illuminates the dark, silent room. **The Priest** is the last to leave, but as he reaches the threshold, he stops, glancing back into the shadows. His gaze falls on a small, dusty chair in the corner.*

*There, he sees a faint, ghostly figure—a young girl sitting quietly, holding the small, sticker-covered notebook. Her eyes are sad, piercing into him with an unsettling intensity.*

**Priest:** (whispering, voice quivering) Who... who are you?

*The girl’s mouth opens slightly, her voice an echo from another world, soft and accusing.*

**Ghostly Girl:** (whispering) Why didn’t you help me?

*The Priest stumbles back, fear etched across his face. He turns to the **Driver**, who is waiting by the door.*

**Priest:** (desperately) Do you see her? The girl... right there in that chair?

**Driver:** (frowning, confused) What are you talking about? There’s no one there.

*The Priest looks back. The girl is gone, and the chair sits empty. A chill runs down his spine as he mutters under his breath.*

**Priest:** (whispering to himself) She was there… I know she was there.

*He hesitates, then steps through the door, glancing back over his shoulder as the door slowly creaks shut behind him.*

*As the room falls silent once more, a faint whisper echoes through the empty space:*

**Voice on Speaker:** *Remember me.*

*The door locks with a final, chilling click, leaving only a profound silence.*

**FADE OUT**
