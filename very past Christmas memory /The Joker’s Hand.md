### **Title: The Game of Guilt**

---

### **Act 1: The Gathering**

**INT. A DIMLY LIT, OMINOUS ROOM – NIGHT**

The room is cold, the only light coming from a flickering overhead bulb that casts long shadows. A large, round table sits in the center. Eight strangers are seated around it, their faces filled with nervous tension.

**At the head of the table stands DR. EVELYN BLACK (40s), a calm but intimidating woman. Her eyes pierce through each person as she surveys the room.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*Coldly*  
You’re here for a reason. Each of you carries a secret, a truth you’ve hidden. Tonight, you will face it. You will each draw a card. The card will decide your fate. Will you reveal your truth, or remain silent? But remember—silence carries a price.

**She gestures to a deck of cards placed in the center of the table.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*After a beat*  
The game begins now.

### **Act 2: The First Revelation**

**Ethan**, a confident man in his 30s, picks up the first card, smirking.

**ETHAN**  
*Reading aloud*  
"Remain silent, and you will face the consequences. Speak, and you will be free from your guilt."  
*He laughs dismissively*  
No way I’m talking. This is a game.

**He leans back in his chair, eyes defiant. Suddenly, a loud *CLICK* rings through the room. Everyone flinches. Without warning, a *gunshot* echoes, and **ETHAN’s body jerks violently** as blood pools on the floor. The room goes deathly still.

**The others freeze in shock.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*Coldly*  
This is the price of silence. The game is not to be taken lightly.

---

### **Act 3: The Confessions Begin**

The tension is palpable. **JONAH** (early 30s, uneasy) nervously picks up the next card.

**JONAH**  
*Reading*  
"Reveal the person you’ve betrayed, or remain silent and face your worst fear."

**He hesitates, clearly terrified by the second option.**

**JONAH**  
*Shaky voice*  
I... I betrayed my best friend. I sabotaged his career, just so I could take his job. I left him to suffer. 

**His confession hangs in the air.** The others exchange uneasy glances. **DR. BLACK** nods approvingly, but it’s clear this is just the beginning.

**DR. BLACK**  
*Coldly*  
You’ve made the right choice. Your burden is now known.

---

**MAYA** (late 20s, visibly shaken) draws the next card. She reads it aloud, her hands trembling.

**MAYA**  
*Reading*  
"You must face your past. Relive the moment you regret most."

**Her face pales as a wave of guilt washes over her. She’s clearly struggling.**

**MAYA**  
*Voice breaking*  
I… I wasn’t there when she needed me. My best friend… she needed me, and I... I just walked away. I left her alone. And now, she’s gone.

**A heavy silence fills the room. Everyone is shaken by her words.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*Coldly*  
Your truth is out. But will it be enough to undo the damage?

---

**LENA** (early 40s, calculating) leans forward, grabbing the next card. She reads it, scanning the room.

**LENA**  
*Reading*  
"Expose someone else in the room who is hiding their truth, or remain silent and feel the weight of your own actions."

**Lena’s sharp eyes scan each person. She knows what she has to do.**

**LENA**  
*Coldly*  
I’ll speak.  
*Pauses*  
I’ve used people to get ahead. I’ve manipulated everyone who helped me climb the career ladder. I’ve betrayed every single one of you.

**The room is still. Her admission is chilling.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*Nods*  
Your truth is heard, Lena. It’s a step toward redemption—if you can even claim that.

---

**LUKE** (early 30s, reserved) draws the next card. His face pales when he reads it.

**LUKE**  
*Voice shaking*  
"You have no choice. You must speak or face an unbearable memory of your darkest moment."

**He swallows hard, his body trembling.**

**LUKE**  
*Whispering*  
I… I killed someone. I didn’t mean to, but I was angry. I just… I didn’t think. I acted without thinking.

**The room falls into stunned silence. Everyone stares at him.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*Coldly*  
Your burden is out in the open. Now you must live with it.

---

### **Act 4: The Shock of the Truth**

**RACHEL** (mid 30s, quiet, haunted) draws the final card. Her hand trembles as she reads it aloud.

**RACHEL**  
*Reading*  
"Reveal the truth about your brother’s death, or remain silent and face the same fate as Ethan."

**The room falls deathly still. All eyes are on Rachel, and she freezes. The weight of the question hangs in the air.**

**RACHEL**  
*Barely a whisper*  
I... I let him die. My brother. He begged me for help. But I didn’t do anything. I was scared. I left him to face it alone. I didn’t intervene... and now, he’s gone.

**A hush falls over the group. A deep silence envelops the room.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*Stepping forward, her voice dark and piercing*  
So, you all played a part in his death. Adam’s death wasn’t random. It was the culmination of all your actions.

**A beat of silence, then the truth finally dawns on them all.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*Grimly*  
Each of you, in your own way, contributed to my brother’s demise. Adam’s death was no accident. It was the result of your neglect, betrayal, and inaction.

---

### **Act 5: The Final Revelation**

**The atmosphere shifts. Dr. Black steps closer, her eyes icy with revelation.**

**DR. BLACK**  
You see, Adam was my brother. His death wasn’t an isolated event. You all let him down. Ethan’s silence. Maya’s abandonment. Jonah’s betrayal. Lena’s manipulation. Luke’s indifference. Rachel’s denial. You all watched him fall, and none of you stepped in.

**The group is in shock, realizing their roles in the tragedy.**

**DR. BLACK**  
*Coldly*  
And now, you’ve all been forced to face your own guilt. I’ve orchestrated this game, not just to punish you, but to make you understand. You all played your part in his death, and you will carry that weight forever.

**Suddenly, the door to the room bursts open. POLICE flood in, arresting each of them.**

**The characters are stunned, confused. They don’t understand why they are being arrested.**

**POLICE OFFICER**  
*To Dr. Black*  
We have everything, Dr. Black. You did well.  

**DR. BLACK**  
*Nods slowly*  
It was never about the game. It was about the truth.

### **Conclusion: The Weight of Truth**

As the characters are led away in handcuffs, **Rachel** stands still, her eyes vacant. **Dr. Black’s words echo in the room**: *"You all played a part in his death..."* 

**Dr. Black watches as they are taken away, a cold satisfaction in her eyes.** 

**FADE TO BLACK.**
