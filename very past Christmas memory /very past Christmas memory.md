### Scene 1
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - UNKNOWN LOCATION - MORNING**

*Eight strangers wake up, disoriented, in a locked, dimly lit room. They look around, confused.*

**Hacker:** Where... where are we?

**Nurse:** I don't remember... was just going about my day.

**Developer:** (scanning the room) Some kind of joke, right?

**Voice on Speaker:** *You are all here because you are hiding a truth. If you want to leave, each of you must confess.*

*The group nervously laughs, brushing it off as a prank.*

**Detective:** Alright, who’s behind this? It’s got to be a joke.

**Mother:** (uneasy) This doesn’t feel like a joke.

*An uneasy silence fills the room as they realize this is real.*

---

### Scene 2
*A red envelope appears mysteriously on a small pedestal in the center.*

**Hacker:** (eyeing it, hesitant) That’s... that’s a data packet. It reminds me of... something.

**Driver:** What’s it to you? You know something?

**Hacker:** (hesitates, then sighs) Fine. Years back, I tried to blackmail someone... a girl. I thought I deleted everything. Guess I was wrong.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*A faint unlocking sound, but the door remains closed. The group begins to feel the weight of the situation.*

---

### Scene 3
*Another red envelope appears on the pedestal. The Developer picks it up, studying it with a cold smirk.*

**Developer:** (revealing an ID card) Yeah, I recognize this. She was an intern... I bullied her, forced her to quit.

**Nurse:** (angrily) You’re... proud of that?

**Developer:** Proud? No. Just didn't care. I do what’s necessary.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The room shifts slightly, building tension.*

---

### Scene 4
*A hospital attendance chart materializes on the pedestal. The Doctor and Nurse exchange a glance.*

**Doctor:** (picks it up, grimacing) We... we ignored her calls for help that night. Left early. She died because we weren’t there.

**Driver:** Aren’t you supposed to save lives?

**Doctor:** (murmurs) I was careless... I’m sorry.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*Everyone is visibly affected by the weight of these confessions.*

---

### Scene 5
*A folder marked "CASE FILE" appears, catching the Detective's attention.*

**Detective:** (sighs, picking it up) I remember this case. Took a bribe to close it. Called it an accident, but it was more than that.

**Mother:** (narrowing her eyes) You denied justice.

**Detective:** (quietly) I did... and I can’t change that.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The door creaks, still firmly shut.*

---

### Scene 6
*A cracked car mirror materializes. The Driver's eyes widen in recognition.*

**Driver:** (shaking) I know what this is. I... I hit a girl. Left her there on the road.

**Priest:** You just... drove away?

**Driver:** (low voice) I panicked... couldn’t face the consequences.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The group grows more somber, fear beginning to replace disbelief.*

---

### Scene 7
*A piece of cloth appears, frayed and torn. The Priest reaches for it with trembling hands.*

**Priest:** I saw her, lying there... I could have helped. But I told myself it wasn’t my duty.

**Doctor:** (shocked) You’re a priest. How could you?

**Priest:** (voice breaking) I was... afraid. Afraid to face what it meant.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The atmosphere becomes increasingly oppressive.*

---

### Scene 8
*A small, brightly decorated notebook with childish doodles appears. The Mother picks it up, a mixture of sorrow and rage on her face.*

**Mother:** (whispering) This was my daughter’s. I wasn’t there when she needed me... not enough, anyway. She reached out... and I ignored her.

**Hacker:** (softly) Your daughter... was she...?

**Mother:** (nods) She’s the one you all wronged. Each of you played a part.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The door creaks louder, but remains shut.*

---

Here’s an expansion of scenes 9 to 14, focusing on each character’s individual confessions with dialogue that deepens the suspense and tension among the group.

---

### Scene 9
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - CONTINUOUS**

*Another red envelope appears, revealing a school report card. The **Nurse** picks it up, her hands shaking.*

**Nurse:** (whispers) I know what this is… the night we ignored her calls, she was trying to get better. (pauses, struggling) She’d just gotten this report, wanted to show me. I told her I didn’t have time...

**Doctor:** (somber) We all thought it was just one more patient, but… we left her when she needed us most.

**Detective:** And neither of you thought to stay?

**Nurse:** (defensively) Don’t you judge me. What about your bribes, Detective?

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The tension rises as the group silently absorbs the confession.*

---

### Scene 10
*A small envelope labeled "CASE CLOSED" materializes. The **Detective** picks it up, unable to meet the others' eyes.*

**Detective:** (grimly) I took money from the hospital to make her case disappear. (pauses) Claimed it was just an accident… that no one was at fault.

**Driver:** (angrily) You knew the truth and covered it up?

**Detective:** (voice trembling) I was paid to say it wasn’t anyone’s fault. Just an accident, another statistic.

**Priest:** (in disbelief) For money, you buried her justice?

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The air becomes heavy with the weight of their combined guilt.*

---

### Scene 11
*The next item appears: a cracked compact mirror. The **Driver** freezes as he recognizes it.*

**Driver:** (almost to himself) I remember this… she dropped it. I… I was the one who hit her with my car. I didn’t even stop to see if she was alive.

**Mother:** (accusatory) You left her there, on the cold pavement.

**Driver:** (ashamed) I didn’t know what to do. I thought someone else would help her.

**Priest:** (under his breath) There was no one else… only us, it seems.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The Driver lowers his head, avoiding the others’ stares.*

---

### Scene 12
*A small rosary lies on the floor. The **Priest** reaches for it, visibly distressed.*

**Priest:** I saw her that night… broken, lying there. I thought, if I stopped, I’d have to face what happened… maybe even lose my place in the church. (pauses) So I walked away.

**Developer:** (coldly) So much for forgiveness, Father.

**Priest:** (whispers) I abandoned her… and myself.

**Mother:** (with cold fury) You turned away when she needed you most. What good is your faith if it crumbles when tested?

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The room feels more stifling as the confessions pile up.*

---

### Scene 13
*A small, well-worn book appears, covered in colorful stickers. The **Mother** picks it up, tears in her eyes.*

**Mother:** (voice trembling) This was my daughter’s. She loved to draw in it, to share every little thought. (pauses, struggling) But I… I was never there. I didn’t see her pain… until it was too late.

**Hacker:** (softly) She was… just a child, wasn’t she?

**Mother:** (brokenly) Yes. And all of you… you took her away. Bit by bit, choice by choice.

**Voice on Speaker:** *Confession accepted. Partially unlocked.*

*The others look away, their remorse growing unbearable.*

---

### Scene 14
*The room becomes eerily silent. The final object appears: a torn piece of fabric, stained with dried blood. Everyone stares, realizing the full weight of their involvement.*

**Mother:** (voice filled with sorrow and rage) This… this was her favorite dress. The one she wore the night she… (voice breaking) the night she was taken from me.

**Priest:** (guilty) We all failed her… each of us, in some way.

**Developer:** (whispering) We could have stopped it. We could have… (trails off)

**Voice on Speaker:** *Final confession. All parts unlocked.*

*The door unlocks with a loud click, swinging open to reveal a dark, empty corridor.*

---

### Scene 15
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - LATER**

*The Mother stands at the center of the group, everyone staring at her, shocked and disturbed.*

**Mother:** (sighs) You understand now. I wanted you all to feel what you did to her, to relive every moment you stripped from her life. (voice trembling) I want you to carry this with you forever... because I carry her absence every day.

**Priest:** (whispering) So this... this is all your doing?

**Mother:** Yes. You needed to understand, to see yourselves for what you are. (with conviction) This was her justice.

*She looks each of them in the eye, her gaze cold and resolute.*

**Voice on Speaker:** *Final confession. The story is complete.*

*The door slowly opens with a heavy groan, revealing a dark corridor.*

---

### Scene 16
*The group stands before the open door, hesitant. Each one bears the burden of their confessions, looking lost and defeated.*

**Detective:** (to Mother) Will we ever really leave this place?

**Mother:** (coldly) She will never leave me. Now you carry her too.

*One by one, the group members step through the door, somber and remorseful.*

---
Here’s the scene modified to reflect the Priest’s experience, where he is the only one who sees the ghostly figure of the girl, and the Driver denies her presence.

---

### Scene 17
**INT. LOCKED ROOM - EMPTY - MOMENTS LATER**

*The last few people are stepping through the open door, their footsteps echoing as they leave the dim, silent room. **The Priest** is about to exit when he notices a small, dusty chair in the far corner. He freezes, staring.*

*In the chair sits the faint, ghostly figure of a young girl, clutching a small notebook. Her eyes are wide and sorrowful, fixed on him. A chill fills the air as the Priest takes a step closer, unable to look away.*

**Priest:** (whispering, shaken) Who… who are you?

*The girl’s expression deepens, sadness filling her gaze. She opens her mouth, her voice soft and distant, like an echo.*

**Ghostly Girl:** (whispering) Why didn’t you help me?

*The Priest stumbles back, his face pale, and turns to the **Driver**, who is waiting by the door.*

**Priest:** (urgently, pointing) Do you see her? The girl… sitting right there in that chair?

**Driver:** (frowning, looking around) What are you talking about? There’s no one there.

*The Priest turns back to the chair, his heart pounding. The girl is gone; the chair now sits empty and still. He takes a shaky breath, his mind racing.*

**Driver:** (concerned) You coming? Or are you seeing ghosts now?

*The Priest looks at the empty chair one last time, haunted by what he’s seen.*

**Priest:** (to himself, under his breath) She was there… I know she was there.

*He hesitates, then exits, glancing back as the door slowly closes behind him. The room goes dark and silent, a chilling breeze passing through. Just as the door clicks shut, a faint whisper echoes through the empty room:*

**Voice on Speaker:** *Remember me.*

*The door locks with a final, echoing click, leaving only silence.*

**FADE OUT**
