### **Scene 1**

*Setting: A dimly lit room with sparse furnishings—a few folding chairs and a single table. The 10 characters wake up, groggy and disoriented. A faint camera hums in the corner.*

**EMILY**  
(whispering)  
Does anyone remember how we got here?

**ETHAN**  
(surveying the room)  
No… but this doesn’t feel random.

**MEGAN**  
(sarcastic)  
And here I thought I was just being invited to a horror-themed escape room.

**LIAM**  
(smiling grimly)  
Whoever brought us here wants something.

**DAVID**  
(scanning the others)  
They can’t just expect us to sit around and wait.

**FELIX**  
(nervously)  
I don’t like this. Feels like they’re watching us… studying us.

**JAVIER**  
(calmly)  
Everyone needs to stay calm. Panicking won’t help.

**CALVIN**  
(quietly)  
Maybe we’re here for a reason—like a reckoning.

**MILES**  
(eyeing the camera)  
Or maybe it’s payback. Question is, for what?

**JORDAN**  
(whispering)  
Maybe... it’s something we all forgot.

*The intercom crackles, and a distorted, robotic voice speaks.*

### **Scene 2**

**VOICE**  
Welcome. Your past holds the key to your freedom. Reveal it, and you may leave.

**MEGAN**  
(muttering)  
So much for a straight answer.

**LIAM**  
(smiling coldly)  
“Your past.” Sounds like they’re expecting confessions.

**ETHAN**  
But why us? What do we all have in common?

**FELIX**  
(wide-eyed)  
This is an experiment. They’re making us dig into our darkest secrets.

**DAVID**  
I don’t have any dark secrets. Maybe this is all a mistake.

**EMILY**  
(calmly)  
If you don’t have any, David, why are you here?

**JAVIER**  
(to everyone)  
Let’s think rationally. What’s the last thing each of us remembers?

**CALVIN**  
(brooding)  
Maybe they don’t want us to remember. Maybe that’s the game.

**MILES**  
(glaring)  
Or maybe it’s a trap—to see if we’ll turn on each other.

### **Scene 3**

*A drawer slides open, revealing a small locket. MEGAN picks it up, her expression shifting.*

**MEGAN**  
This… this was my sister’s.

**JORDAN**  
(softly)  
Looks like they’re bringing out our ghosts.

**LIAM**  
(sarcastically)  
Your sister’s locket? They must’ve dug deep for that.

**MEGAN**  
(defensively)  
This is hers, alright. No one else could know.

**CALVIN**  
(watching her closely)  
Are they trying to remind us of something? Force us to remember?

**ETHAN**  
Maybe each of us has something here. Something we’d rather forget.

**DAVID**  
(scoffs)  
This is absurd. We’re not here because of jewelry.

**MILES**  
No, but we’re here because of something. Let’s figure out what.

**JAVIER**  
(sternly)  
If it’s memories they want, we’ll find out soon enough.

**FELIX**  
(muttering)  
They’re unlocking pieces of our pasts… one by one.

### **Scene 4**

*A compartment opens, revealing a photograph of a young girl with bright eyes. The room shifts with a palpable silence.*

**JAVIER**  
(frowning)  
Who is she?

**EMILY**  
(whispers, almost to herself)  
Someone… none of you would forget if you knew the truth.

**MEGAN**  
(looking around)  
Does she mean something to one of us?

**ETHAN**  
(uneasy)  
More than one, it seems.

---

### **Scene 5**

*A dusty envelope marked with DAVID’s name drops onto the table. He picks it up, hands trembling.*

**DAVID**  
(whispering, voice cracking)  
No… this can’t be.

**LIAM**  
(amused)  
Oh, but it is, isn’t it? What does it say?

**DAVID**  
(glances at the group, eyes filled with fear)  
It’s about that night… the night she was taken.

**CALVIN**  
(grimly)  
The girl… the one in the photograph.

**EMILY**  
(voice hardening)  
And what did you do that night, David?

**DAVID**  
(broken)  
I tried to save her, but… I failed.

---

### **Scene 6**

*A sudden realization washes over the group as ETHAN picks up a tarnished police badge from another drawer.*

**ETHAN**  
(whispers)  
This was mine. I led the investigation… and it went cold.

**JORDAN**  
(softly, almost breaking)  
We all let her down, didn’t we?

**FELIX**  
(whispering, wide-eyed)  
She was someone’s daughter. This is about her.

---

### **Scene 7**

*The intercom buzzes, filling the room with static.*

**VOICE**  
Only the pure of heart may leave. The rest… will remain.

**MEGAN**  
(smirking, hiding fear)  
Pure of heart? Good luck with that.

**JAVIER**  
(to the group)  
So, who will face what they did?

**ETHAN**  
(somberly)  
Or didn’t do.

---

### **Scene 8**

*A small, worn-out diary appears in the center of the table, untouched.*

**JORDAN**  
(voice shaking)  
I drew her once… before she vanished.

**MILES**  
(sneering)  
And some of us wrote stories that should’ve stayed buried.

**EMILY**  
(eyes filled with restrained pain)  
She was more than just a story. More than a headline. She deserved better… from all of us.

---

### **Final Scene: Scene 9**

*The lights flicker and dim. Silence stretches, broken only by shallow breaths.*

**ETHAN**  
(looking at EMILY)  
Who was she, really?

**EMILY**  
(voice trembling, a tear slipping down)  
My daughter. You were all there, in some way. Your actions, your silence—it all led here.

**CALVIN**  
(whispers, eyes wide)  
This room… it’s not just for us. It’s for her.

*The revelation settles in. Each character’s face reflects the weight of shared guilt.*

**VOICE**  
Only the truth will set you free.

*FADE OUT.*

**THE END**
