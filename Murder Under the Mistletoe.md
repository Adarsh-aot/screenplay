### **Scene 1**

**[Setting: A lush, tropical island pier on Christmas Eve. The friends arrive, laughing and marveling at the surroundings.]**

**Chris**  
_(stretching)_  
Finally, we’re here! Can you believe this place? It’s like we stepped into a postcard.

**Rachel**  
It’s perfect. Palm trees, private beach, and not a single tourist in sight.

**Emma**  
_(smiling subtly)_  
Just us and the ocean. Merry Christmas, everyone.

**Liam**  
First things first—who’s up for a swim?

**James**  
_(nervous)_  
A swim? Out there? In that deep, dark ocean?

**Tom**  
Oh, come on, James. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience!

**Brian**  
I’m just saying, I hope this “luxury” includes some luxury snacks. I didn’t come all this way to survive on coconuts.

**David**  
_(grinning)_  
Relax, we’re here to unwind. Now, who’s claiming the biggest room?

---

### **Scene 2**

**[Setting: Villa terrace as storm clouds gather ominously. The friends notice the changing weather.]**

**David**  
Did anyone check the forecast? Because this storm looks like it’s here to stay.

**Ethan**  
Welcome to the tropics. Storms come and go quickly here. We’ll just ride it out.

**Rachel**  
It’s kind of exciting, don’t you think? Adds some thrill to the adventure.

**Emma**  
_(gazing at the storm)_  
Or maybe a little danger. After all, we’re completely isolated here.

**Tom**  
Danger, schmanger. We’ve got food, drinks, and a roof over our heads.

**Liam**  
_(laughing)_  
Let’s make the most of it, right? Who’s in for some holiday drinks?

---

### **Scene 3**

**[Setting: Villa living room, cozy with decorations. Emma quietly places a folded note on a side table.]**

**Rachel**  
_(finding the note)_  
Guys, look at this… It says, “Warning: There’s a killer on the loose.” 

**David**  
What? That’s ridiculous. Is this some kind of prank?

**Max**  
_(laughing)_  
Probably the island staff having a little fun with the tourists.

**James**  
But we’re the only ones here. Who would leave a note like that?

**Brian**  
Right, because killers always announce themselves with a handwritten note. Relax, it’s just someone’s sick idea of a joke.

**Emma**  
_(feigning concern)_  
Maybe… or maybe we shouldn’t ignore it. You never know.

**Liam**  
Enough of the spooky stuff. Let’s celebrate Christmas Eve! Drinks, anyone?

---

### **Scene 4**

**[Setting: Villa kitchen. Chris is alone, getting snacks when he senses someone behind him.]**

**Chris**  
Alright, I know someone’s there. Rachel? Emma? Quit trying to scare me.

**[The lights flicker as Chris hears a noise, then suddenly the lights go out. He screams, and silence follows.]**

---

### **Scene 5**

**[Setting: Living room, next morning. The group gathers, and Rachel notices Chris is missing.]**

**Rachel**  
Has anyone seen Chris? He didn’t come back last night.

**Tom**  
Maybe he crashed somewhere else. You know Chris, always looking for adventure.

**Ethan**  
Or maybe he got spooked by that “killer” note and went off exploring.

**Emma**  
_(feigning concern)_  
But we should find him, right? He wouldn’t just vanish.

**David**  
Okay, let’s split up and check around the villa.

**James**  
_(whispering)_  
I don’t like this. What if that note was serious?

**Brian**  
Come on, don’t start with that again. Chris is probably just playing hide-and-seek.

---

### **Scene 6**

**[Setting: The beach, as the search continues. Brian, James, and Max discuss the eerie feeling settling in.]**

**Brian**  
First a storm, now a missing friend. Not exactly the relaxing holiday I planned.

**James**  
I’m telling you, something feels wrong. Like we’re not alone here.

**Max**  
It’s just nerves. Besides, if there was a killer here, wouldn’t they have, I don’t know, introduced themselves?

**Brian**  
You’re not funny, Max. We need to be on our guard.

**Max**  
Relax, Brian. Chris will show up any minute. Probably laughing at us for worrying.

---

### **Scene 7**

**[Setting: Poolside, sunset. David and Emma sit by the pool, tension between them.]**

**David**  
Emma, you’ve been acting… strange since we got here. Is something going on?

**Emma**  
Nothing. Just… maybe this place wasn’t such a good idea.

**David**  
This was your idea, remember? You practically dragged us here.

**Emma**  
_(smiling softly)_  
I guess I just wanted something… special. To make some lasting memories.

**David**  
Well, you’re definitely making this Christmas unforgettable.

---

### **Scene 8**

**[Setting: Villa, night. A scream echoes as Rachel finds Max’s lifeless body in a side room. The group panics.]**

**Rachel**  
_(sobbing)_  
Oh my God… Max… he’s dead. He’s really dead.

**Liam**  
_(terrified)_  
This can’t be happening. We’re supposed to be safe here!

**Tom**  
Who would do this? And why Max? He never hurt anyone.

**Emma**  
_(calmly)_  
Maybe someone here has a grudge. Or maybe it’s that warning. Someone’s making a point.

**Ethan**  
We have to be smart. No one leaves alone from now on. Agreed?

**David**  
Agreed. Let’s stay close, keep our eyes open, and figure out what’s going on.

---

### **Scene 9**

**[Setting: Villa’s living room, Christmas morning. Only three survivors left: Emma, David, and Rachel.]**

**David**  
Emma… why did you really bring us here?

**Emma**  
What? Don’t be ridiculous, David. I wanted us to have a holiday.

**Rachel**  
Emma, it doesn’t make sense. Chris, Max, all these things happening. It’s not normal.

**Emma**  
_(smiling coldly)_  
Not normal? You’re the one who ignored me all last year, remember?

**David**  
Wait, Emma… are you saying you did this?

**Emma**  
_(revealing her anger)_  
You didn’t care, David. None of you did. And now… now I have your attention.

**Rachel**  
Emma… you couldn’t… You didn’t—

**Emma**  
Oh, but I did. Every scream, every panic, it was all planned. Merry Christmas.

---

### **Scene 10**

**[Setting: Villa terrace, moments after the reveal. David pulls out his phone, remembering something.]**

**David**  
Emma, you’re not the first to think of this. Before we left, I downloaded a news alert about a killer… it was for another town, miles away.

**Emma**  
_(taken aback)_  
What?

**Rachel**  
So you made up the warning? You did all this… for what? A twisted sense of revenge?

**Emma**  
I… I didn’t think you’d check. I thought I could just… control everything here.

**David**  
Well, looks like you weren’t as clever as you thought. Merry Christmas, Emma.

**Emma**  
_(whispering)_  
I just wanted you all to pay for forgetting me.

**[Curtain falls, leaving the stage in haunting silence.]**

**End of Play**
