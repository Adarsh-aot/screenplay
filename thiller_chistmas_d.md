**Scene 1: The Christmas Celebration**

*(The friends arrive at the mansion, admiring the holiday decorations. Christmas carols play softly in the background as they share a toast in front of a grand Christmas tree. The warm atmosphere is slightly unnerved by the isolated surroundings.)*

**Michael**  
(Looking around, smiling)  
Lydia, you went all out with the decor. This place looks… hauntingly beautiful.

**Lydia**  
(Smirking)  
Christmas magic, Michael. Isn’t that what you wanted?

**Sean**  
(Grinning)  
Or maybe Christmas *mischief*? It’s like one of those mystery thrillers—perfect setup.

**Evan**  
(Nervous, glancing around)  
More like a horror movie. Places like this, they have histories… things that never leave.

**Camilla**  
(Rolling her eyes)  
Come on, Evan. Let’s not ruin the holiday with ghost stories.

**Marie**  
(Shivering)  
I don’t know, it feels… strange here, like we’re being watched.

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping in, with a calm smile)  
Relax. I’m here to make sure it’s a safe, *silent* night.

**Isabelle**  
(Whispering to Lydia)  
A detective… why exactly did you invite him?

**Lydia**  
(Playfully)  
Just in case, Isabelle. After all, Christmas can bring out… surprises.

*(They raise their glasses in a toast, but the underlying tension hints at something darker.)*

---

**Scene 2: The First Disappearance**

*(As the group sits by the fireplace exchanging stories, the lights flicker and go out. When they come back on, Dylan is missing. Everyone looks around, confused.)*

**Michael**  
(Frowning)  
Did… anyone see where Dylan went?

**Nina**  
(Smirking, but a bit uneasy)  
Alright, Dylan, enough with the games. This isn’t the time for hide-and-seek.

**Camilla**  
(Looking around suspiciously)  
Is this part of the “Christmas surprise,” Lydia? A prank, maybe?

**Lydia**  
(Putting on an innocent face)  
Why would you think that?

**Evan**  
(Panicked)  
This is exactly how it starts… vanishing without a trace, like he was taken by something… unseen.

**Detective Grant**  
(Calmly)  
Stay together, everyone. This place is large. Maybe he’s just… around the corner.

**Isabelle**  
(Stepping back)  
Or maybe he was taken by someone *here*…

**Marie**  
(Trembling)  
I don’t like this, Lydia. It feels like we’re not alone.

**Sean**  
(Joking nervously)  
Come on, maybe Dylan’s just testing our holiday spirit.

*(The group reluctantly agrees to stay together, but the mood has shifted from lighthearted to tense.)*

---

**Scene 3: Paranoia Creeps In**

*(They search the mansion for Dylan, finding no trace. Upon returning to the main room, suspicions mount.)*

**Camilla**  
(Sharply)  
Lydia, what is going on? Why does this place feel… cursed?

**Lydia**  
(Coldly)  
I wanted everyone to have a *memorable* Christmas. Why don’t you ask Michael? He’s always digging for mysteries.

**Michael**  
(Shrugging, watching her carefully)  
I’m just here to celebrate, Lydia. Not to play games.

**Detective Grant**  
(Eyes narrowing)  
In cases like these, it’s usually the last person you’d suspect.

**Evan**  
(Panicking)  
Stop with the detective talk, Grant! We need answers, not riddles.

**Isabelle**  
(Breathing heavily)  
This isn’t just a game, is it? We need to get out of here… now.

**Sean**  
(With dark humor)  
Isabelle, the snowy woods aren’t exactly safer than this haunted mansion.

**Marie**  
(Pleading)  
Please, can we all stay together? I don’t want any more surprises.

*(They agree to stay close, glancing around suspiciously. Every look is now filled with distrust.)*

---

**Scene 4: Camilla’s Vanishing Act**

*(As they argue about what to do, a loud bang echoes through the house. They rush to investigate, only to realize Camilla has disappeared.)*

**Nina**  
(Shocked)  
No… Camilla was right here with us! How did this happen?

**Michael**  
(Inspecting the room)  
No signs of struggle, no trace… nothing. It doesn’t make sense.

**Lydia**  
(Coolly)  
Maybe she wanted to leave. People aren’t always as predictable as you think.

**Detective Grant**  
(Nodding slowly)  
Or maybe she knew something… something worth keeping quiet.

**Evan**  
(His voice trembling)  
If there’s a killer here… why haven’t we heard anything? It’s like… they’re among us.

**Sean**  
(Deflecting)  
Or maybe we all have reasons we aren’t talking about.

**Isabelle**  
(Terrified)  
What… what are you saying, Sean? Are you accusing us?

**Michael**  
(Calmly)  
Everyone needs to calm down. Panic won’t solve anything.

**Marie**  
(Crying)  
But what if we’re next? I don’t want to die here.

*(The tension in the room is palpable as they eye each other with a mix of fear and suspicion.)*

---

**Scene 5: Turning on Each Other**

*(With two friends gone, the group is now openly suspicious. Detective Grant tries to regain control, but his own role is questioned.)*

**Nina**  
(Whispering to Marie)  
I don’t trust Lydia. She knows something… she’s too calm.

**Detective Grant**  
(Clearing his throat)  
Everyone, let’s focus. We stick together, no matter what.

**Sean**  
(Smirking)  
Maybe that’s just what *they* want us to do.

**Isabelle**  
(Panicked)  
Stop it! All these accusations are only making things worse.

**Evan**  
(Trembling)  
This is a nightmare… first Dylan, then Camilla… who’s next?

**Michael**  
(Stepping forward)  
Detective’s right. We don’t split up. No one leaves this room.

**Lydia**  
(Challenging)  
What’s wrong, Michael? Afraid of what you might find?

**Marie**  
(Shaking)  
Why would anyone do this? Who’s capable of something so… horrible?

**Michael**  
(Staring at Lydia)  
Someone with a plan… and a grudge.

*(Their suspicion intensifies as they realize they’re trapped with someone who wants them all dead.)*

---

**Scene 6: Hints of a Dark Past**

*(The group sits in uncomfortable silence until Lydia starts hinting at secrets, unsettling everyone.)*

**Lydia**  
(Smiling darkly)  
Funny, isn’t it? How we all have skeletons that seem to find their way back during the holidays…

**Nina**  
(Suspiciously)  
What secrets, Lydia? You’re hiding something, aren’t you?

**Lydia**  
(Casually)  
Oh, nothing… just that some of us aren’t as innocent as we seem.

**Evan**  
(His voice shaking)  
What does that mean? Whose secrets are you talking about?

**Detective Grant**  
(Intervening)  
Secrets aren’t important now. We need to survive.

**Sean**  
(Nervously laughing)  
Easy for you to say, Detective. You don’t look like a target.

**Isabelle**  
(To Lydia)  
Why did you invite us here? Was this all a setup?

**Michael**  
(Stepping forward)  
Maybe Lydia has an answer. Care to explain, Lydia?

**Lydia**  
(Smirking)  
Oh, Michael… be careful what you wish for.

*(The group is now more suspicious of each other than ever, with Lydia’s hints stoking the fire.)*

---

**Scene 7: Vanishing in the Dark**

*(The lights suddenly flicker, and when they stabilize, Nina is gone. The panic and dread intensify.)*

**Michael**  
(Furiously)  
Enough of these games, Lydia! What’s happening?

**Lydia**  
(Smirking)  
Why are you looking at me? Or are you just looking for someone to blame?

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping between them)  
Calm down. If we panic, we’re as good as lost.

**Sean**  
(Frantically)  
Lost? We’re all sitting ducks here.

**Marie**  
(Hyperventilating)  
Why is this happening? Why us?

**Isabelle**  
(Whispering)  
Maybe it’s not about what we did… but what someone wants us to *believe* we did.

**Evan**  
(Hysterically)  
Enough talking in circles! We need to leave this nightmare!

**Michael**  
(To Lydia)  
I’m going to figure out what you’re hiding… whether you like it or not.

*(They stare each other down as the tension rises, everyone unsure of who’s friend or foe.)*

---

**Scene 8: The Final Revelation**

*(With only Michael, Lydia, and Detective Grant left, Michael finally pieces together the twisted plot.)*

**Michael**  
(Realizing, voice low)  
It was you all along, Lydia… You planned this. But why?

**Lydia**  
(Coldly)  
Because they deserved it, Michael. Every last one of them.

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping back in shock)  
Wait… you’re saying you orchestrated all of this?

**Lydia**  
(Smirking)  
Consider it a Christmas gift, Michael. One they’ll never forget.

**Michael**  
(Stunned)  
You killed them—our friends. Was this all a sick game?

**Lydia**  
(Unapologetic)  
They weren’t friends. They were loose ends, waiting to be tied up.

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping forward)  
This ends here, Lydia. You’re not leaving this house.

**Lydia**  
(Shrugging)  
My work here is done, Detective.

*(She stands calmly, almost victorious as Michael and Detective Grant prepare to bring her to justice.)*

---

**Scene 9: The Final Struggle**

*(As Lydia tries to escape, Michael and Detective Grant confront her in a final standoff, a struggle that echoes through the mansion.)*

**Michael**  
(Yelling)  
It’s over, Lydia! No more lies.

**Lydia**  
(Laughing)  
You think you can stop me? You don’t understand, Michael. This was always meant to end this way.

**Detective Grant**  
(Blockading her path)  
Your game is up, Lydia. There’s no way out now.

**Lydia**  
(Glaring)  
You don’t get it. None of you ever did.

**Michael**  
(Resolute)  
We get it now. And it’s finished.

**Detective Grant**  
(Restraining her)  
This nightmare ends tonight, Lydia.

*(The lights fade as Lydia is finally subdued, bringing an eerie end to the deadly Christmas gathering.)*

**End of Play.**
