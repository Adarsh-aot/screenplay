### **Scene 1: Arrival and Suspicion**

*(Guests arrive and take in the mansion’s impressive Christmas decorations, unaware of the deadly undercurrents brewing.)*

**Michael**  
(Admiring the decor)  
Lydia, you really went all out. It’s beautiful… almost surreal.

**Lydia**  
(Smiling with a hint of mystery)  
Only the best for my dear friends. It’s Christmas… a time for making memories.

**Sean**  
(Chuckling)  
Or nightmares. This place is just a little too perfect, you know? Like the setting for a horror movie.

**Nina**  
(Smiling)  
Maybe a murder mystery. I half expect one of us to vanish before the night’s over.

**Detective Grant**  
(Calmly)  
Let’s not give anyone ideas, hmm?

**Isabel**  
(A little anxious)  
Detective Grant… why did Lydia invite you to a Christmas gathering?

**Lydia**  
(Smiling mysteriously)  
Precaution, Isabel. Christmas gatherings can… bring surprises.

*(There’s an awkward silence as glasses are raised for a toast, though tension is already building in the air.)*

---

### **Scene 2: The First Disappearance**

*(As they settle in and chat, the lights flicker briefly. When they come back on, Dylan is nowhere to be found.)*

**Michael**  
(Looking around)  
Did anyone see where Dylan went?

**Nina**  
(Rolling her eyes)  
Dylan, enough with the hiding! This isn’t funny.

**Lydia**  
(Amused)  
Perhaps he couldn’t handle the atmosphere.

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping forward, calm)  
Let’s stay together. It’s safer that way.

**Isabel**  
(Shrinking back, anxious)  
Or maybe… something happened to him.

**Marie**  
(Whispering)  
I have a bad feeling about this…

**Sean**  
(Shrugging it off)  
Come on, it’s probably just Dylan messing around. He loves playing pranks.

*(They reluctantly agree to stick together, but Michael notices a cryptic holiday card left behind on Dylan’s seat.)*

**Michael**  
(Holding up the card, reading aloud)  
“To the one who hides, remember… secrets don’t stay hidden forever.”

*(The group exchanges uneasy glances, but tries to dismiss it.)*

---

### **Scene 3: Growing Tension**

*(As the night progresses, the group continues celebrating, though some begin to feel uneasy. Michael approaches Isabel privately.)*

**Michael**  
(Whispering)  
Isabel… is everything alright? You’ve been on edge since we arrived.

**Isabel**  
(Looking away)  
It’s just… this place. And Lydia. It feels like she’s testing us, somehow.

**Michael**  
(Troubled)  
Maybe we’re all just paranoid. But… if anything feels wrong, come to me.

*(Unknown to them, Lydia watches from the shadows, pleased with the rift forming.)*

---

### **Scene 4: Camilla’s Disappearance**

*(As they gather around the fireplace, they notice Camilla is no longer in the room. Tension escalates as another card appears, found by Nina.)*

**Nina**  
(Picking up the card, reading aloud)  
“Those who see too much may not be able to see for long…”

**Evan**  
(Steps back, horrified)  
What does that mean? Why would someone leave that here?

**Detective Grant**  
(Attempting to calm the group)  
Let’s not jump to conclusions. Maybe Camilla just… stepped out for some air.

**Sean**  
(Sarcastically)  
Yeah, because going off alone in a spooky mansion is a great idea.

**Isabel**  
(Shaking, under her breath)  
This isn’t right… none of this is right.

**Nina**  
(Suspicious)  
Funny how these cards keep showing up near *you*, Isabel.

**Isabel**  
(Stammering)  
I didn’t— I don’t know anything about these cards!

**Lydia**  
(Smiling slightly)  
It’s strange, isn’t it? Secrets have a way of finding us… don’t they, Isabel?

*(Isabel begins to feel cornered as suspicion mounts, with Lydia subtly encouraging it.)*

---

### **Scene 5: Secrets and Discoveries**

*(Michael explores part of the house, only to stumble upon a small, hidden room filled with pictures of himself. Some pictures are scratched out, while others are decorated with obsessive notes. He realizes the extent of Lydia’s fixation.)*

**Michael**  
(Horrified, whispering)  
Lydia… what is this?

*(He finds a card placed on the dresser, reading it aloud with a trembling voice.)*

**Card**  
“To the one who got away… no one truly escapes the past.”

*(Michael feels the weight of Lydia’s obsession but decides to keep it to himself for now, fearing it will worsen the group’s panic.)*

---

### **Scene 6: Isabel Under Fire**

*(The group reconvenes, growing more anxious as they fail to locate either Dylan or Camilla. Suddenly, Nina points an accusatory finger at Isabel.)*

**Nina**  
(Pointing)  
I don’t care what anyone says—Isabel has something to do with this! She’s been acting strange all night!

**Evan**  
(Nervous)  
It’s always the quiet ones, isn’t it?

**Isabel**  
(Desperate)  
No! I haven’t done anything! Why would I?

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping between them)  
We can’t just turn on each other without proof. Let’s stay calm.

**Lydia**  
(Smirking, adding fuel)  
Sometimes the quietest people have the loudest secrets, don’t they, Isabel?

*(Isabel, feeling trapped and vulnerable, glances at Michael, but he is torn and remains silent. Her isolation grows.)*

---

### **Scene 7: Isabel’s Tragic End**

*(As accusations fly, a piercing scream is heard. They rush to find Isabel’s body, with a holiday card in her hand reading: “Love lost… is love avenged.” Shockwaves ripple through the group.)*

**Nina**  
(Gasping)  
It wasn’t her? She wasn’t the killer?

**Evan**  
(Terrified)  
Then… who is doing this?

**Marie**  
(Crying)  
I can’t believe we blamed her… and now she’s gone.

**Michael**  
(Whispering, guilt-ridden)  
Isabel… I’m so sorry.

*(Michael realizes too late that Isabel was innocent, heightening his guilt. Lydia watches with satisfaction.)*

---

### **Scene 8: Detective Grant’s Revelation**

*(As the remaining group members—Michael, Lydia, Detective Grant, and Marie—gather in a dimly lit room, Detective Grant pieces the mystery together.)*

**Detective Grant**  
(Coldly)  
Each of these cards, each disappearance… they’re too well-planned to be random.

**Michael**  
(Putting it together)  
Dylan, Camilla, Sean… Isabel. They were all tied to our pasts. Lydia… why did you invite us here?

*(Lydia feigns innocence but begins to lose her calm under the detective’s gaze.)*

**Detective Grant**  
(Looking at Lydia)  
Each death, each disappearance, led us right back to you. You brought us here, Lydia, to play this twisted game, didn’t you?

**Lydia**  
(Coldly, breaking her facade)  
It’s about time someone noticed. I thought my clues were obvious. None of you cared about me. You all treated me like I was invisible. I was going to make sure none of you ever forgot me.

**Michael**  
(Heartbroken)  
So… you did all of this? To us?

**Detective Grant**  
(Piecing it together)  
Dylan was your first, lured into the shadows with your “games.” Camilla—she was wary of you, and so you silenced her. Isabel… she was nothing more than a pawn to you, wasn’t she?

**Lydia**  
(Smiling)  
Isabel took you from me, Michael. And if I couldn’t have you, I’d make sure no one else could.

---

### **Scene 9: The Final Twist**

*(Detective Grant moves to restrain Lydia, but she pulls out one last card with a chilling message for Michael.)*

**Lydia**  
(Holding up the card)  
You’ll never be free of me, Michael. Even if it’s from a prison cell, I’ll haunt you. This is my gift to you… a memory that will never fade.

**Card**  
“Christmas is for making memories… the kind that never leave.”

*(Lydia is finally taken away, her twisted game exposed. The survivors—Michael, Detective Grant, and Marie—reflect on the night.)*

**Detective Grant**  
(To Michael)  
Sometimes, when jealousy festers, it consumes everything.

**Marie**  
(Crying softly)  
This night… it’s changed us. We’ll never be the same.

**Michael**  
(Sighing)  
Lydia’s grudge destroyed her. She couldn’t let go… and look where it led.

**Detective Grant**  
(Wisely)  
Perhaps this is a reminder: jealousy builds walls around the heart… but love, real love, forgives.

*(The survivors share a somber, reflective silence, ending the story with a chilling realization of jealousy’s power.)*

**End of Play.**
