**Scene 1: The Christmas Celebration**

*(Friends arrive at the mansion, admiring the beautiful decorations and the warm glow of the Christmas lights. The initial warmth is quickly overshadowed by the isolation and Lydia’s mysterious demeanor.)*

**Michael**  
(Admiring the decor)  
Lydia, you really went all out this year. It’s beautiful… almost surreal.

**Lydia**  
(Smiling with a hint of mystery)  
Only the best for my friends. It’s Christmas, after all… a time for making memories.

**Sean**  
(Laughing)  
Or nightmares. This place looks straight out of a horror movie.

**Isabel**  
(Nervously)  
Lydia… why did you invite Detective Grant? A detective at a holiday party?

**Lydia**  
(Smiling)  
Oh, just in case. Christmas gatherings can bring up… surprises.

**Camilla**  
(Glancing around)  
It’s beautiful, but… there’s something eerie about it, too.

**Evan**  
(Muttering)  
I can feel it too… like we’re being watched.

**Detective Grant**  
(Calmly)  
Let’s not let our imaginations run wild. It’s just a quiet, old house.

*(They raise their glasses for a toast, unaware that this Christmas gathering will be unlike any other.)*

---

**Scene 2: The First Disappearance**

*(As the group settles in and begins exchanging stories, the lights flicker and go out briefly. When they return, Dylan is missing. The group grows tense.)*

**Michael**  
(Frowning)  
Did… anyone see where Dylan went?

**Nina**  
(Laughing nervously)  
Alright, Dylan, enough with the games. This isn’t funny.

**Lydia**  
(Smiling mysteriously)  
Maybe Dylan decided to explore… or maybe he couldn’t handle the atmosphere.

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping forward, calm)  
Everyone, let’s stay together. It’s safer that way.

**Isabel**  
(Shrinking back, anxious)  
Or maybe… something happened to him.

**Marie**  
(Whispering)  
I knew something was wrong about this place…

**Sean**  
(Deflecting)  
It’s probably just a prank. But let’s keep an eye out… in case he’s hiding somewhere.

*(The group reluctantly agrees to stay together, but unease sets in.)*

---

**Scene 3: More Disappearances and Suspicions**

*(The friends search the mansion but find no sign of Dylan. When they return, Camilla has also vanished without a trace. Tension rises, and suspicions start to form.)*

**Michael**  
(Examining the room)  
This is no prank. Someone’s doing this… deliberately.

**Nina**  
(Casting a suspicious look at Isabel)  
And some of us have more reason than others. Like our *friend* Isabel.

**Isabel**  
(Panicked)  
Why would you think it’s me? I’m just as scared as you are!

**Evan**  
(Nervous)  
It’s always the quiet ones, isn’t it?

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping between them)  
Calm down. Let’s not accuse each other without proof. We need clear minds to get out of this.

**Lydia**  
(Smirking)  
Let’s be honest… we all have secrets. Maybe some people have more reason to hide them.

**Sean**  
(Smirking)  
I say we just keep our distance. No telling who’s next.

**Marie**  
(Crying)  
Please… can we just stay together? I don’t want anyone else to disappear.

*(The suspicion around Isabel grows, but Michael remains quiet, conflicted.)*

---

**Scene 4: Isabel Confronts Michael**

*(Michael and Isabel find themselves alone, and Isabel finally confronts him about their past.)*

**Isabel**  
(Hurt)  
Michael, I don’t understand… how could you just leave me like that, years ago? Was I really not good enough?

**Michael**  
(Softly)  
It wasn’t about being “good enough.” I… I thought you deserved better.

**Isabel**  
(Scoffing)  
Better? Or just someone with more money and connections?

**Michael**  
(Avoiding her gaze)  
Isabel, I’m married now. Whatever happened between us… it’s in the past.

**Isabel**  
(Teary)  
Maybe for you. But for me, it’s still here. This place, these people—they all remind me of what I lost.

*(They’re interrupted by a loud crash, bringing them back to the reality of their dangerous situation.)*

---

**Scene 5: Another Disappearance, More Accusations**

*(After the crash, the group realizes that Sean has disappeared. Suspicion against Isabel deepens, and Lydia subtly fuels it, planting seeds of doubt in everyone’s mind.)*

**Nina**  
(Furious)  
Isabel, you’re the one with a grudge. You have every reason to hurt us!

**Isabel**  
(Defensive)  
No, I wouldn’t! I could never do that. This isn’t me!

**Detective Grant**  
(Cutting in)  
Everyone, let’s keep level heads. Nothing is clear yet.

**Lydia**  
(Smirking)  
Let’s face it—jealousy makes people do strange things, doesn’t it, Isabel?

**Evan**  
(Horrified)  
If she’s capable of that… what else is she hiding?

**Michael**  
(Defensive)  
Isabel may have her faults, but this… this is too far. We don’t know who’s doing this.

**Marie**  
(Sobbing)  
Why is this happening to us? What have we done to deserve this?

**Detective Grant**  
(Firmly)  
The killer is counting on us to fall apart. We have to stay strong.

*(Isabel’s isolation intensifies as everyone suspects her, except Michael.)*

---

**Scene 6: Isabel’s Sudden Death**

*(As they discuss what to do, a piercing scream fills the air. They rush to find Isabel dead in another room, sending shock waves through the group.)*

**Nina**  
(Gasping)  
It wasn’t… her? She wasn’t the killer?

**Evan**  
(Trembling)  
Then who is? Who among us would do this?

**Marie**  
(Horrified)  
I can’t believe this. We blamed her… and she’s gone.

**Michael**  
(Whispering)  
Isabel… I’m so sorry.

**Lydia**  
(Feigning sympathy)  
A tragedy… truly. But perhaps now we’ll be safe, right?

**Detective Grant**  
(Eyeing Lydia suspiciously)  
No… there’s something we’re missing. We need to understand what’s motivating this.

**Michael**  
(Looking at Lydia)  
Lydia… you brought us here. Why? Why now?

**Lydia**  
(Smirking)  
Maybe because Christmas is a time for making… things right.

*(Her cryptic response sets Michael on edge, though he hasn’t pieced it all together.)*

---

**Scene 7: The Final Revelation**

*(The remaining group members—Michael, Lydia, Detective Grant, and Marie—confront Lydia. Detective Grant begins piecing together the mystery, pointing out Lydia’s motive.)*

**Detective Grant**  
(Looking at Lydia)  
You were behind this, weren’t you? The one orchestrating every disappearance.

**Lydia**  
(Smirking)  
It’s about time someone noticed. I thought my clues were obvious.

**Michael**  
(Horrified)  
Lydia… you killed them? Why?

**Lydia**  
(Coldly)  
Because, Michael, I loved you. I watched as everyone—including you—cast me aside for “love,” for people like Isabel. I had to teach you all a lesson.

**Detective Grant**  
(Piecing it together)  
You manipulated Dylan into exploring the house alone, and when he did, you struck. Then, Camilla… she was wary of you, and you silenced her. One by one, you eliminated everyone who didn’t value you. Isabel was only the latest, a scapegoat.

**Lydia**  
(With dark satisfaction)  
Isabel was nothing. She took you from me… all because she was so “innocent.”

**Michael**  
(Bitterly)  
But what did you gain, Lydia? Everyone’s gone… and you’ve become the monster.

---

**Scene 8: A Final Moral**

*(Lydia is finally restrained by Detective Grant, her twisted scheme exposed. The survivors—Michael, Detective Grant, and Marie—reflect on the tragic night.)*

**Detective Grant**  
(To Michael)  
Sometimes, when jealousy festers, it destroys everything it touches.

**Marie**  
(Crying softly)  
This night… we’ll never be the same.

**Michael**  
(Sighing)  
Lydia’s grudge consumed her. She couldn’t let go… and look where it led.

**Detective Grant**  
(Wisely)  
Perhaps this is a reminder: jealousy only builds walls. Love… forgives.

*(The survivors embrace, reflecting on the tragic consequences of jealousy, ending the story with a quiet, somber realization about the importance of forgiveness and letting go.)*

**End of Play.**
