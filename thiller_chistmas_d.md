**Characters:**
- **Michael** – A successful, high-class man, analytical and reserved. He is married to Lydia, though there are signs of a complex, unresolved past with Isabel. He strives to maintain control over everything.
- **Lydia** – Poised, charming, and deeply invested in her image. She’s highly manipulative but initially appears as the perfect hostess, showering everyone with warmth and kindness. Beneath her beauty and graciousness, however, lies a dangerous obsession with Michael.
- **Detective Oliver Grant** – Invited by Lydia as a safety precaution, he quickly becomes integral to unraveling the sinister events that unfold. Calm, composed, and insightful.
- **Isabel** – Michael’s former lover, now a more withdrawn figure, marked by the pain of being abandoned for someone wealthier. She comes off as cold and bitter at first, but her vulnerability and true intentions are gradually revealed.
- **Nina** – Bold, outspoken, and brash. She isn’t afraid to challenge anyone, even when the group starts to unravel.
- **Evan** – Easily frightened, especially as the supernatural aspects of the night start to unsettle him. His nervousness deepens the group’s paranoia.
- **Camilla** – Observant, intelligent, and cautious. She harbors suspicions about Lydia and keeps a close eye on her.
- **Sean** – Charismatic and the life of the party. His humor helps mask the creeping tension, but even he can’t avoid the growing sense of dread.
- **Dylan** – Distant and aloof, he keeps to the background, making him an easy target when things start to unravel.
- **Marie** – Sensitive and easily overwhelmed. Her emotional vulnerability makes her an easy target for suspicion.

**Scene 1: The Christmas Celebration**  

*(The friends arrive at the mansion, admiring the elegant decorations. The warmth inside contrasts with the cold, desolate landscape outside. Lydia’s gracious hospitality is on full display.)*  

**Michael**  
(Admiring the decor)  
Lydia, this place is incredible. You’ve truly outdone yourself. It’s like we’re in a dream.

**Lydia**  
(Smiling warmly, her charm palpable)  
Thank you, Michael. It’s Christmas—time for perfection. Everyone deserves to feel special tonight.

**Sean**  
(Laughing, looking around)  
It’s like stepping into a fairy tale… or a slasher flick.

**Isabel**  
(Glancing nervously)  
Lydia… I don’t understand. Why would you invite Detective Grant? Is this just a precaution, or is something more going on here?

**Lydia**  
(Smiling, her voice smooth)  
Just being cautious. A large gathering can sometimes bring surprises, and I’d rather be prepared.

**Camilla**  
(Scanning the room)  
It’s beautiful, but there’s something unsettling about it, too. Almost like the house is hiding something.

**Evan**  
(Muttering)  
Yeah… like we’re being watched. This place doesn’t feel right.

**Detective Grant**  
(With a calm demeanor)  
It’s just an old house. Let’s not let our imaginations run wild. Enjoy the evening, everyone.

*(They raise their glasses for a toast, unaware that the night’s true terror is only beginning.)*

---

**Scene 2: The First Disappearance**  

*(The group is in high spirits, exchanging stories. Suddenly, the lights flicker and go out for a moment. When they come back on, Dylan is missing.)*  

**Michael**  
(Frowning)  
Did anyone see where Dylan went?

**Nina**  
(Laughing nervously)  
Alright, enough with the jokes. This isn’t funny, Dylan.

**Lydia**  
(Smiling, maintaining her composure)  
Perhaps he got spooked… or needed some time alone. I’m sure he’ll turn up soon.

**Detective Grant**  
(Calmly)  
Let’s stay together, everyone. It’s safer that way.

**Isabel**  
(Anxious)  
Or maybe something happened to him…

**Marie**  
(Whispering)  
I knew there was something off about this place…

**Sean**  
(Trying to lighten the mood)  
It’s probably just a prank. But let’s keep an eye out, just in case.

*(Despite the uncertainty, they reluctantly agree to stay together, the tension starting to rise.)*

---

**Scene 3: More Disappearances and Suspicion**  

*(As the group searches the mansion for Dylan, they return to find Camilla gone as well. The group’s tension is palpable.)*  

**Michael**  
(Looking around the room)  
This is no prank. Someone is doing this intentionally. We need to figure out who.

**Nina**  
(Accusingly)  
Isabel… you seem to know too much. Maybe you have more reason to want us gone.

**Isabel**  
(Defensive, panicked)  
What? No! I’m just as scared as all of you!

**Evan**  
(Nervously)  
It’s always the quiet ones who turn out to be the killer, right?

**Detective Grant**  
(Stepping in)  
Let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to stay calm.

**Lydia**  
(Sweetly)  
Everyone has their secrets. Maybe some of us have more to hide than others.

**Sean**  
(Smiling wryly)  
Maybe we should all just keep our distance. Who knows who’s next?

**Marie**  
(Tearfully)  
Please… can we just stay together? I don’t want anyone else to disappear.

*(Suspicion falls heavily on Isabel, but Michael seems torn, unable to fully believe the accusations.)*

---

**Scene 4: Isabel Confronts Michael**  

*(Isabel and Michael find themselves alone in the hallway, and Isabel finally confronts him.)*  

**Isabel**  
(Emotional, voice trembling)  
How could you, Michael? How could you just leave me behind, for someone like her? Was I never good enough?

**Michael**  
(Sighing, regretful)  
It wasn’t about being good enough. I thought you deserved more than what I could offer… more than what I was willing to give.

**Isabel**  
(Bitterly)  
So you picked her? Someone with more wealth, more power. Did you really think I could ever compete with that?

**Michael**  
(Quietly)  
Isabel, I’ve moved on. You should too. This—what happened between us—it’s in the past.

**Isabel**  
(Scoffing)  
The past? You moved on so easily, but for me, it’s all still here.

*(The conversation is interrupted by a loud crash, shaking them both into the present danger.)*

---

**Scene 5: Another Disappearance, More Accusations**  

*(The group realizes that Sean is the next to disappear. The suspicion against Isabel intensifies, with Lydia subtly fueling the flames.)*  

**Nina**  
(Accusing Isabel)  
You have a motive, don’t you? A deep grudge. You’re the one with something to gain.

**Isabel**  
(Frantic)  
No! I would never hurt anyone. This isn’t me!

**Detective Grant**  
(Cutting in, sternly)  
We need to stay calm. We don’t have enough to point fingers yet.

**Lydia**  
(Softly, with an edge)  
Jealousy can make people do terrible things. We’ve all seen it.

**Evan**  
(Horrified)  
If Isabel could do this… what else is she hiding?

**Michael**  
(Standing up, protective)  
I won’t stand for this. Isabel’s not the killer. We don’t know who is yet.

**Marie**  
(Crying)  
Why is this happening? Why are we being punished?

**Detective Grant**  
(Firmly)  
Whoever is doing this is counting on us falling apart. We have to hold it together.

*(Isabel’s isolation deepens, but Michael’s loyalty to her remains evident.)*

---

**Scene 6: Isabel’s Sudden Death**  

*(After a loud scream, the group discovers Isabel’s body in a separate room. The shock is overwhelming.)*  

**Nina**  
(Gasping)  
It wasn’t… her? She wasn’t the killer?

**Evan**  
(Trembling)  
Then who? Who’s behind this?

**Marie**  
(Horrified)  
We blamed her… and now she’s gone.

**Michael**  
(Whispering, broken)  
Isabel… I’m so sorry.

**Lydia**  
(Feigning sympathy)  
Such a tragedy… but maybe now we’ll be safe.

**Detective Grant**  
(Studying Lydia carefully)  
No… we’re missing something. There’s more to this than we realize.

**Michael**  
(Looking at Lydia, suspicion growing)  
Lydia… you brought us here. Why? Why now?

**Lydia**  
(Smiling faintly, with coldness in her eyes)  
  
Maybe because Christmas is a time for making things right. For purging old wounds, don’t you think?

*(Her words linger in the air, sending a chill through the group. Michael’s suspicion deepens, though he struggles to connect the dots.)*

---

**Scene 7: The Final Revelation**

*(The group has gathered in the drawing room, tension thick in the air. Detective Grant steps forward, piecing together the mystery, his eyes narrowing as he focuses on Lydia.)*

**Detective Grant**  
(Looking directly at Lydia)  
You orchestrated this all, didn’t you? Every disappearance, every death. This was all planned.

**Lydia**  
(Smirking, a dark satisfaction in her voice)  
It took you long enough to figure it out. I thought the signs were obvious.

**Michael**  
(Shocked and horrified)  
Lydia… why? Why would you do this?

**Lydia**  
(Coolly)  
Because I loved you, Michael. You all cast me aside for people like Isabel—people with no real worth, no status. You took her back, rejected me, and she took you from me. 

*(Her voice grows colder, more venomous.)*

**Lydia**  
I needed to teach everyone a lesson. I wanted you all to understand what happens when you forget who truly matters. Isabel was just a pawn. She was nothing but a tool in my game, but you… you were the prize.

**Detective Grant**  
(Piecing the timeline together)  
One by one, you eliminated everyone who didn’t value you. And Isabel… Isabel was the final one, your scapegoat.

**Lydia**  
(With a sinister calm)  
Isabel was the perfect target. She was weak, and she was foolish enough to believe you still cared. She was the one who never let go. But now, she’s gone. And so is everyone who stood in my way.

**Michael**  
(Voice bitter, filled with disbelief)  
But what did you gain, Lydia? You’ve killed everyone. You’ve destroyed everything. Now, there’s nothing left.

**Lydia**  
(Shrugging, unconcerned)  
It wasn’t about the people, Michael. It was about the message. I wanted you to feel what I felt—the pain of being overlooked, of being cast aside. You’ll never understand the kind of sacrifice I made for you.

*(Her gaze softens momentarily, but only to twist the knife deeper.)*

**Lydia**  
(Slowly)  
This is my Christmas gift to you. A lesson in who really matters. A lesson in what happens when love turns to obsession.

*(Detective Grant steps forward, restraining Lydia as she smirks at her twisted triumph. Michael stands there, struggling with the gravity of Lydia’s confession.)*

---

**Scene 8: A Final Moral**

*(The remaining survivors—Michael, Detective Grant, and Marie—are left in the aftermath of Lydia’s arrest. The mansion, once filled with laughter and warmth, is now a chilling reminder of the night’s horrors. The survivors sit in silence, processing the chaos they’ve just lived through.)*

**Detective Grant**  
(To Michael, his voice heavy with wisdom)  
Sometimes, when jealousy festers, it consumes everything. It doesn’t just destroy the person you’re jealous of—it destroys everyone around you, too.

**Marie**  
(Sobbing softly)  
This… this night has broken us all. We’ll never be the same again. I can’t… I can’t ever forget what happened here.

**Michael**  
(Sighing deeply, his voice low)  
Lydia’s grudge consumed her. She couldn’t let go of the past. She thought she could force love, but it only turned her into something monstrous.

**Detective Grant**  
(With quiet resolve)  
Jealousy builds walls that can never be torn down. Love, on the other hand, it forgives. It lets go of the past and doesn’t destroy what it touches.

**Michael**  
(Looking around, his expression somber)  
It’s too late for any of that now. Too late for anyone to truly heal. But maybe… maybe we can learn something from this.

*(The survivors stand, the weight of their experiences heavy on their shoulders. They exit the mansion, leaving behind the scene of terror, each carrying their own heavy burden of what they lost and what they’ve learned.)*

**End of Play.**
