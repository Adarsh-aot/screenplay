### **Scene 1**

*Setting: A dark, windowless room with a dim overhead light. The characters are all waking up, disoriented and wary. The walls are bare, and a dusty table with several folding chairs is in the center. A camera is mounted on the ceiling, its lens trained on them.*

**EMILY**  
(quietly, eyeing the others)  
Does anyone have any idea where we are?

**ETHAN**  
(grumbling)  
No idea, but I’m not sticking around. Who’s behind this?

**MEGAN**  
(sarcastic)  
And here I thought my kidnappers would be more… upscale.

**LIAM**  
(smirking)  
I’m more concerned with *why* we’re here. This isn’t some random abduction.

**DAVID**  
(confused, glancing around)  
I don’t remember… anything about how I got here. It’s like a blur.

**FELIX**  
(panicked)  
This is some government experiment. I knew they were watching me.

**JAVIER**  
(firmly)  
Everyone calm down. If we panic, we’ll get nowhere.

**CALVIN**  
(muttering to himself)  
Sins are punished in strange ways...

**MILES**  
(interrupting)  
Did anyone do something recently they’re ashamed of? Something that might have triggered… this?

**JORDAN**  
(whispering, staring at the floor)  
Sometimes, it’s what we don’t remember that gets us.

---

### **Scene 2**

*An intercom crackles to life, filling the room with a distorted, robotic voice.*

**VOICE**  
Welcome. Each of you holds the key to your escape. Find it within… if you can.

**FELIX**  
(almost screaming)  
Who are you? Why are you doing this?!

**LIAM**  
(sharply)  
Save your breath. Whoever it is, they’re not answering.

**MEGAN**  
(eyeing the camera)  
They’re watching us. And from the sound of it, they want something… something we have.

**ETHAN**  
(frowning)  
“Find it within”? What are we supposed to do, meditate?

**JORDAN**  
(slightly dazed)  
Maybe… it’s a confession. Something they want us to admit.

**DAVID**  
(scoffing)  
I have nothing to confess. This is just someone’s sick game.

**EMILY**  
(watching everyone closely)  
But why *us*? We’re strangers. What could we possibly share?

**CALVIN**  
(murmuring)  
We’re only strangers on the surface. Secrets go deeper.

**JAVIER**  
(sternly)  
Secrets or not, we need a plan. Let’s figure out what each of us remembers.

**MILES**  
(cynically)  
Or maybe that’s exactly what they want—turn us against each other.

---

### **Scene 3**

*A drawer on the far side of the room slides open on its own. Inside is a tarnished bracelet. MEGAN picks it up, her expression turning solemn.*

**MEGAN**  
(hesitating)  
This… this was my sister’s.

**LIAM**  
(skeptical)  
You’re sure? How would they know about something so personal?

**MEGAN**  
(defensive)  
I don’t know! But this is hers… I’d know it anywhere.

**ETHAN**  
(glaring at MEGAN)  
So, they’re digging up pieces of our lives. What else are they planning to dredge up?

**JAVIER**  
(to MEGAN)  
Did your sister… did something happen to her?

**MEGAN**  
(distantly)  
Yes. She… disappeared. No one knows where she went, and I was blamed.

**FELIX**  
(wild-eyed)  
See? They’re putting us here to face our demons. We’re all guilty of something.

**DAVID**  
(smirking)  
And what are *you* guilty of, Felix? Not staying off those conspiracy forums?

**CALVIN**  
(cutting in)  
Mock him all you want, but we all have something we’d rather not remember.

**MILES**  
(sighing)  
Fine. But we’re here now, so let’s see if this bracelet leads us anywhere.

---

### **Scene 4**

*The intercom buzzes again.*

**VOICE**  
Only those who confront the past may leave. The rest… will remain.

**LIAM**  
(coldly)  
Confront what? We’ve barely scratched the surface.

**EMILY**  
Maybe that’s the point. They want us to dig deeper, relive it all.

**FELIX**  
(reluctantly)  
Alright, then. I’ll go first. I… I lied to someone. Hurt them badly. Never confessed.

**JORDAN**  
(softly)  
Sometimes words hurt more than actions.

**ETHAN**  
(skeptical)  
Not sure that’s the type of confession they want. This feels… darker.

**CALVIN**  
(intensely)  
Darker, yes. Something you bury so deep, you almost forget.

**DAVID**  
(hiding his discomfort)  
Well, maybe some things *should* stay buried.

**MEGAN**  
(sharp)  
Or maybe it’s time we all face what we’ve done. If they know this much about us, they won’t let us go without it.

**MILES**  
(resigned)  
Then let’s keep digging. See what else this room has in store.

### **Scene 5**

*The lights flicker, and another compartment opens. Inside is a newspaper clipping of a hit-and-run accident. DAVID’s face goes pale.*

**DAVID**  
(whispering)  
This… this can’t be here. I was never caught…

**JAVIER**  
(suspiciously)  
Never caught? You mean… you were involved?

**DAVID**  
(angrily)  
It was an accident! I didn’t mean to… but I couldn’t turn back.

**EMILY**  
(studying him)  
And now it’s here, staring you down. Do you feel guilty?

**LIAM**  
(mockingly)  
Or are you more afraid of getting caught?

**MEGAN**  
(to DAVID)  
Maybe we’re here to face more than just guilt. This could be our punishment.

**ETHAN**  
(firmly)  
Enough. Let’s keep moving. This room isn’t done with us yet.

**FELIX**  
(whispering, paranoid)  
They know everything… They’re forcing us to look into the mirror.

**JORDAN**  
(almost inaudible)  
But what happens when we don’t like what we see?

---

### **Scene 6**

*Another item is revealed: a framed photo of a young child. CALVIN picks it up, visibly shaken.*

**CALVIN**  
(murmuring)  
I… I could have saved them. But I… I hesitated.

**MILES**  
(interrupting)  
What do you mean, “hesitated”?

**CALVIN**  
(voice trembling)  
It was a moment… a single moment. And that’s all it took for everything to fall apart.

**LIAM**  
(sarcastic)  
The priest with regrets. How original.

**EMILY**  
(to CALVIN, softly)  
Everyone’s haunted by something, Calvin. You’re not alone.

**JAVIER**  
(slightly defensive)  
Is this supposed to be therapy? Because it feels more like torture.

**DAVID**  
(agitated)  
So, what now? We just keep dredging up our nightmares until they let us out?

**FELIX**  
(hysterical)  
They won’t let us out! This is a prison, and we’re here forever!

**MEGAN**  
(defiantly)  
We’ll get out. We just have to keep going.

---

### **Scene 7**

*The characters are tense, pacing around, anxiously eyeing one another.*

**ETHAN**  
(suspiciously, to MEGAN)  
So, the bracelet… your sister’s. Is it why you’re here?

**MEGAN**  
(bitterly)  
What does it matter? None of us are innocent.

**JORDAN**  
(quietly)  
Maybe innocence isn’t the point. Maybe… it’s forgiveness.

**DAVID**  
(scoffs)  
Forgiveness? This is revenge. Nothing more.

**LIAM**  
(to DAVID)  
Speak for yourself. But you’re right about one thing—we’re here to pay.

**CALVIN**  
(gazing at the photo)  
Then we pay. We have to, if there’s any chance of escape.

**EMILY**  
(firmly)  
And if we don’t? If we refuse to confess?

**FELIX**  
(panicking)  
Then we rot here! Forever!

**JAVIER**  
(to all)  
Then let’s not give them the satisfaction. Let’s confront it all, and end this.

---

### **Scene 8**

*The final compartment opens, revealing a burned letter with EMILY’s name. The group stares at her, suspicious.*

**LIAM**  
(narrowed eyes)  
Care to explain, Dr. Carter?

**EMILY**  
(sighing deeply)  
I… I brought you here. All of you.

**DAVID**  
(shocked)  
You what?

**EMILY**  
(bitterly)  
You all destroyed lives—*my* life. This was the only way to make you see.

**MEGAN**  
(disbelieving)  
So, you orchestrated this? Everything?

**ETHAN**  
(accusing)  
And now what? We confess and you let us walk free?

**EMILY**  
(somberly)  
Confess. Repent. Or stay. It’s your choice.

*The room falls silent as they each confront the consequences of their actions, their fates uncertain.*

*FADE OUT.*

**THE END**
