### **Scene 1**

*Setting: A dimly lit room with sparse furnishings—a few folding chairs and a single table. The 10 characters wake up, groggy and disoriented. A faint camera hums in the corner.*

**EMILY**  
(whispering)  
Does anyone remember how we got here?

**ETHAN**  
(surveying the room)  
No… but this doesn’t feel random.

**MEGAN**  
(sarcastic)  
And here I thought I was just being invited to a horror-themed escape room.

**LIAM**  
(smiling grimly)  
Whoever brought us here wants something.

**DAVID**  
(scanning the others)  
They can’t just expect us to sit around and wait.

**FELIX**  
(nervously)  
I don’t like this. Feels like they’re watching us… studying us.

**JAVIER**  
(calmly)  
Everyone needs to stay calm. Panicking won’t help.

**CALVIN**  
(quietly)  
Maybe we’re here for a reason—like a reckoning.

**MILES**  
(eyeing the camera)  
Or maybe it’s payback. Question is, for what?

**JORDAN**  
(whispering)  
Maybe... it’s something we all forgot.

---

### **Scene 2**

*The intercom crackles, and a distorted, robotic voice speaks.*

**VOICE**  
Welcome. Your past holds the key to your freedom. Reveal it, and you may leave.

**MEGAN**  
(muttering)  
So much for a straight answer.

**LIAM**  
(smiling coldly)  
“Your past.” Sounds like they’re expecting confessions.

**ETHAN**  
But why us? What do we all have in common?

**FELIX**  
(wide-eyed)  
This is an experiment. They’re making us dig into our darkest secrets.

**DAVID**  
I don’t have any dark secrets. Maybe this is all a mistake.

**EMILY**  
(calmly)  
If you don’t have any, David, why are you here?

**JAVIER**  
(to everyone)  
Let’s think rationally. What’s the last thing each of us remembers?

**CALVIN**  
(brooding)  
Maybe they don’t want us to remember. Maybe that’s the game.

**MILES**  
(glaring)  
Or maybe it’s a trap—to see if we’ll turn on each other.

### **Scene 3**

*A drawer slides open, revealing a small locket. MEGAN picks it up, her expression shifting.*

**MEGAN**  
This… this was my sister’s.

**JORDAN**  
(softly)  
Looks like they’re bringing out our ghosts.

**LIAM**  
(sarcastically)  
Your sister’s locket? They must’ve dug deep for that.

**MEGAN**  
(defensively)  
This is hers, alright. No one else could know.

**CALVIN**  
(watching her closely)  
Are they trying to remind us of something? Force us to remember?

**ETHAN**  
Maybe each of us has something here. Something we’d rather forget.

**DAVID**  
(scoffs)  
This is absurd. We’re not here because of jewelry.

**MILES**  
No, but we’re here because of something. Let’s figure out what.

**JAVIER**  
(sternly)  
If it’s memories they want, we’ll find out soon enough.

**FELIX**  
(muttering)  
They’re unlocking pieces of our pasts… one by one.

---

### **Scene 4**

*A new compartment opens, revealing a tarnished police badge. ETHAN picks it up, his face clouding over.*

**ETHAN**  
(whispers)  
This was mine… from a case I’d rather forget.

**LIAM**  
(grins)  
So, you’re not as clean-cut as you seem.

**ETHAN**  
(glares)  
I did what I had to do, alright?

**MEGAN**  
(skeptical)  
What did you have to do, exactly?

**ETHAN**  
(shakes his head)  
It doesn’t matter. None of it does. Not anymore.

**EMILY**  
But maybe that’s why we’re here—to face what we buried.

**DAVID**  
(smirking)  
Maybe *you* buried things. Some of us just want to go home.

**JAVIER**  
(to DAVID)  
You seem awfully defensive.

**DAVID**  
(sighs)  
Can’t blame me for not buying into this twisted therapy session.

**JORDAN**  
(whispering)  
Sometimes, the things we run from find us anyway.

---

### **Scene 5**

*The intercom buzzes again, filling the room with static.*

**VOICE**  
Confession is the key. Without it, you will remain.

**FELIX**  
(shouting)  
What do you want us to confess?!

**EMILY**  
(quietly)  
Our pasts. It’s all about what we’ve done.

**CALVIN**  
(grimly)  
Confessions… but some of us have secrets buried too deep to share.

**MEGAN**  
(smirking)  
Sounds like you’ve got something to hide, Calvin.

**CALVIN**  
(coldly)  
And what if I do? I’m not the only one.

**JAVIER**  
(breaking the tension)  
Enough. We’re all here for a reason. Let’s find out what.

**DAVID**  
(annoyed)  
This isn’t going anywhere. We need to do something.

**MILES**  
But if we’re being forced to confess, someone in here might know more than they’re letting on.

---

### **Scene 6**

*A dusty envelope drops from the ceiling, marked with DAVID’s name. He picks it up, his hands trembling as he reads a note inside.*

**DAVID**  
(whispering, to himself)  
No… they couldn’t know.

**LIAM**  
(amused)  
Oh, but they do, don’t they?

**MEGAN**  
(curious)  
What’s it say, David?

**DAVID**  
(angrily)  
Nothing that concerns you.

**JORDAN**  
(softly)  
Secrets only hurt when we hide them.

**ETHAN**  
(to DAVID)  
You’re here for a reason. Just like the rest of us.

**DAVID**  
(bitterly)  
You don’t know anything about me.

**EMILY**  
Maybe that’s the point. We’re here to see each other for who we really are.

**CALVIN**  
(chuckling)  
Maybe we’re all just waiting to see who cracks first.

**MILES**  
(intense)  
Then let’s keep going. Let’s see who’s willing to crack.

---

### **Scene 7**

*Another compartment opens, revealing a photograph of a child. CALVIN picks it up, his face turning pale.*

**CALVIN**  
(trembling)  
No… I thought I’d put this behind me.

**JAVIER**  
(quietly)  
But it found you, didn’t it?

**MEGAN**  
(to CALVIN)  
Who is it?

**CALVIN**  
(whispering)  
A child I… I didn’t save. I had a chance, but I didn’t take it.

**LIAM**  
(mockingly)  
What kind of priest lets a child suffer?

**CALVIN**  
(defensive)  
You don’t know anything about me.

**MILES**  
(smirking)  
No one’s a saint in here, are they?

**EMILY**  
(whispering)  
That’s what we’re here for… our failures.

**ETHAN**  
(cutting in)  
Let’s keep going. We’re bound to figure this out.

---

### **Scene 8**

*The intercom crackles back to life.*

**VOICE**  
Only the pure of heart may leave. The rest… will remain.

**DAVID**  
(mocking)  
Pure of heart? We’re all damned if that’s the case.

**LIAM**  
(to the group)  
So, who’s lying about their past?

**MEGAN**  
(smirking)  
Maybe we all are.

**JORDAN**  
(softly)  
We lie to ourselves most of all.

**FELIX**  
(muttering)  
They’re forcing us to confront the worst parts of ourselves.

**ETHAN**  
(wryly)  
Good luck with that, Felix.

**EMILY**  
But we can’t leave until we face it… all of it.

**JAVIER**  
Then let’s get this over with. Who’s next?

---

### **Scene 9**

*The lights flicker and dim, then come back on. A book with a burned corner is revealed on the table. EMILY picks it up, face drawn.*

**ETHAN**  
(suspiciously)  
What’s that, Emily?

**EMILY**  
(breathes deeply)  
A reminder. Of what I lost.

**MEGAN**  
You’re saying you have something to confess?

**EMILY**  
(mysterious)  
Maybe. We all do. But some things… aren’t easy to forgive.

**DAVID**  
(sneering)  
So, you’re the saint, huh?

**JAVIER**  
Enough. We’ve all done things. Now, what did you do?

**EMILY**  
(slowly)  
Sometimes, justice isn’t about forgiveness. It’s about understanding.

**CALVIN**  
(suspiciously)  
Understanding what, exactly?

---


### **Scene 10** (Updated)

*The final compartment opens, revealing a letter with Emily’s name. The group stares at her in suspicion.*

**LIAM**  
(furious)  
What’s this? You knew something?

**EMILY**  
(sighing, eyes heavy with grief)  
Yes. I brought you all here.

**MEGAN**  
(shocked)  
What? Why?

**EMILY**  
(voice trembling)  
Because each of you played a part in destroying the one thing that mattered most to me—my daughter, Aone.

**ETHAN**  
(stunned)  
Your daughter…?

**EMILY**  
(tears glistening)  
Aone was just a child, full of life, hope. But your actions, your selfish decisions, took her away from me.

**CALVIN**  
(defensive)  
How could we have known? We didn’t—

**EMILY**  
(interrupting, a sudden sharpness in her tone)  
No. You knew. Maybe not her name or her face, but you knew the lives you were impacting. Each bribe, every lie, each reckless action set off a chain that ended in her death.

*The room falls silent, the weight of her words crushing them.*

**JORDAN**  
(whispers)  
It wasn’t just one of us… it was all of us?

**EMILY**  
(nods slowly)  
Yes. Liam, with your schemes. Megan, with your hacking and leaks. Ethan, with your case that was botched… each of you contributed.

**DAVID**  
(angrily)  
So, what’s this? Some kind of elaborate revenge plot?

**EMILY**  
(steadying herself)  
No. This is justice. Only those who can truly confront their guilt and seek redemption can leave. The rest stay, haunted by what they’ve done.

**MILES**  
(realizing, horrified)  
You mean… only the pure of heart?

**EMILY**  
(somberly)  
Only those who face the truth without denial. The truth of Aone’s death, the truth of your roles in it.

*Ethan drops to his knees, eyes closed, reliving a moment of failure. Calvin looks down, hands trembling as he remembers a phone call he ignored. Megan's face falls, guilt piercing her facade.*

**JAVIER**  
(softly)  
We’re all guilty.

**EMILY**  
(voice cracking, but resolute)  
Admit it, confront it… and maybe you can leave.

---

*FADE OUT as the characters stand in a circle, haunted, yet beginning to understand their part in Emily’s tragic loss.*

**THE END**
