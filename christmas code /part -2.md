**Title:** The Christmas Code

---

**Scene 1**

**CO-WORKER 1**


*INT. OFFICE - CHRISTMAS EVE - NIGHT*

The office is adorned with Christmas lights and garlands. Eight colleagues are gathered, enjoying holiday drinks and decorating. **ALEX**, a quiet developer, sits at his computer, watching the others with a small, reserved smile. Suddenly, an alert appears on his screen.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"You are all complicit in a murder. Justice will come tonight."*

**ALEX**  
(whispering to himself)  
What is this…?

He glances around at his colleagues, all still laughing and talking. He shakes his head and goes back to decorating, unnerved.

---

**Scene 2**

*INT. OFFICE - BREAK ROOM - ONE HOUR LATER*

A scream rings out, breaking the cheer. Everyone rushes to the break room, gasping at the sight of **JAMIE** sprawled on the floor, a knife lodged in her back.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(horrified)  
Oh my God! Jamie! Is she…?

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(shaken)  
Someone… someone killed her.

**ALEX**  
(nervously stepping forward)  
Everyone—earlier, I got a strange message. It said we’re all guilty of something and that justice was coming tonight.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(accusatory)  
And you didn’t tell us? Alex, what if you knew this was going to happen?

**ALEX**  
(defensive)  
I thought it was just some sick joke! I didn’t think—

His computer pings with another message, and everyone turns to look.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The one who backstabbed to rise higher has paid the price."*

**CO-WORKER 4**  
(stunned)  
Jamie… she got her promotion by sabotaging Chris, didn’t she?

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(frightened)  
It’s like… it’s punishing us for things we did. Does that mean we’re all targets?

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(nervously)  
What else do they know? What else have we done?

**ALEX**  
(uneasy)  
Whoever this is, they know more about us than we’d like to believe.

---

**Scene 3**

*INT. OFFICE - MAIN ROOM - LATER*

The group huddles around, tense and silent, occasionally glancing suspiciously at each other. Another ping breaks the silence.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The keeper of secrets will choke on her lies."*

**CO-WORKER 5**  
(trembling)  
What does that mean?

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(suspiciously)  
Lena, you’ve been keeping secrets in the finance department, haven’t you?

**LENA**  
(defensive)  
It’s not like I hurt anyone! I just covered up a small breach. I had to protect the company… and my job!

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(accusatory)  
You bribed those hackers to keep them quiet. That’s more than just a ‘small’ cover-up, Lena.

**LENA**  
(shouting back)  
It was years ago! I thought it was behind me!

Suddenly, Lena gasps, clutching her throat as she begins to choke.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(screaming)  
Lena! What’s happening?!

Lena collapses, dead, her face twisted in pain. The group backs away, horrified.

**CO-WORKER 4**  
(breathing heavily)  
Who’s doing this? Who knows all these things?

**ALEX**  
(shaky)  
Whoever they are, they’re punishing us. Everything we thought was hidden… it’s all coming back.

---

**Scene 4**

*INT. OFFICE - LATER*

The remaining survivors sit in tense silence, their eyes darting around the room. **CO-WORKER 3** suddenly speaks up.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(angry, on edge)  
Alright, who’s behind this? Who’s sending these messages?

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(pointing at Alex)  
It has to be him! He’s the one getting the messages!

**ALEX**  
(defensive)  
Why would I be orchestrating all of this? I’m just as scared as you!

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(desperately)  
There has to be a way out of this. If we just stay calm—

The computer pings again. Everyone freezes.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The fire that hid the truth will consume the liar."*

**CO-WORKER 4**  
(turning to MAX)  
Max… you set that fire at the old office, didn’t you?

**MAX**  
(defensive)  
So what? I needed to cover up some things. I never thought it would come back to me!

Suddenly, smoke starts seeping in from the room next door. Max’s eyes widen in horror.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(screaming)  
Max! Get out of there!

Max stumbles, coughing, but collapses before he can escape. The group rushes in, only to find him dead, the room filled with smoke and charred documents.

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(stammering)  
It… it’s real. This is all real.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(sobbing)  
We’re trapped… we’re going to die here!

**ALEX**  
(breathing heavily)  
Someone’s making us pay for everything we’ve done. Nothing we’ve buried is staying buried.

---

**Scene 5**

*INT. OFFICE - LATER STILL*

The survivors gather in the center of the room, all on edge. **CO-WORKER 3** turns to the group.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(sobbing)  
Who could possibly know all of this? Who could be doing this?

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(sneering at Alex)  
Maybe Alex. He’s the one with the messages.

**ALEX**  
(frustrated)  
I told you—I don’t know who’s behind this! But we have to stay together if we’re going to survive.

Another ping interrupts him. Everyone tenses up.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The voice that whispered threats will be silenced."*

**CO-WORKER 4**  
(glancing nervously at SOPHIA)  
Sophia… you blackmailed the CEO, didn’t you?

**SOPHIA**  
(defensive)  
Maybe I did, but so what? It’s not like I killed anyone!

Suddenly, she gasps, clutching her throat. She collapses to the ground, her voice silenced forever.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(hysterical)  
This… this isn’t happening. It’s like something out of a nightmare!

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(turning to Alex, accusing)  
I still think you know more than you’re letting on, Alex.

**ALEX**  
(shouting)  
I don’t! Whoever’s doing this has a plan, and we’re all just… pawns.

---

**Scene 6**

*INT. OFFICE - NEARING MIDNIGHT*

Only a few survivors remain. They sit in silence, exhausted and terrified. Another ping breaks the silence.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The forger of fortunes will face a blunt reckoning."*

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(suspiciously, looking at ETHAN)  
Ethan… you forged those documents for that huge loan, didn’t you?

**ETHAN**  
(pleading)  
Yes, okay? But I didn’t hurt anyone… I just needed the money!

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(snarling)  
Looks like that doesn’t matter to whoever’s running this.

Suddenly, a heavy object falls from a shelf, striking Ethan on the head. He collapses, dead.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(distraught)  
This is hopeless… we’re all going to die here, one by one.

**ALEX**  
(looking haunted)  
Someone has turned every secret, every betrayal, into a punishment.

---

**Scene 7**

*INT. OFFICE - PRE-DAWN HOURS*

Only Alex and **CO-WORKER 1** remain, watching each other warily.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(nervous)  
I don’t know about you, Alex… you could be behind this whole thing.

**ALEX**  
(sighing)  
Think about it—if I were behind this, wouldn’t I have spared myself?

A ping sounds, and they both jump.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The hand that fed poison will taste her own malice."*

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(turning to TINA, trembling)  
Tina… you poisoned someone for their job, didn’t you?

**TINA**  
(panicked)  
It was… it was so long ago!

She takes a drink from her coffee, gasping. She collapses moments later.

**ALEX**  
(shaking)  
It’s like some twisted justice… one that spares no one.

---

**Scene 8**

*INT. OFFICE - DAWN*

Only Alex remains. The final message appears.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The mastermind who played the victim now watches his work come to light."*

Alex smirks, his eyes darkening.

**ALEX**  
(quietly, to himself)  
They’ve paid for their sins. Justice is served.

He types one last message into his computer.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

*They have paid for their crimes. Justice is served. The circle is complete.*

As the police arrive, they find Alex lifeless at his desk, his final message illuminating the screen.

**FADE OUT.**
