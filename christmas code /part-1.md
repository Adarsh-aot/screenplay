**Title: "The Christmas Code"**

**FADE IN:**

**INT. OFFICE - NIGHT**

The office is decorated with Christmas lights, a large tree glowing in the corner. The sound of LAUGHTER and cheerful chatter fills the air. A group of eight colleagues are gathered around a table piled high with food and drinks.

**ALEX**, a reserved developer in his late 20s, sits at a computer in the corner, typing furiously. 

**ALEX**  
(to himself)  
Just a few more tweaks...

**JAMIE**, a confident woman in her 30s, strolls over with a drink in hand.

**JAMIE**  
Hey, Alex! Don’t you ever take a break? 

**ALEX**  
(smiling)  
I’m almost done with this security update. 

**JAMIE**  
You and your codes. We’re here to celebrate, not work!

The others at the table CHEER, raising their glasses.

**MAX**  
(calling out)  
Come on, Alex! Join us!

**ALEX**  
(sighs)  
Fine, just let me finish this.

He hits ENTER, then turns away from the screen. 

**INT. OFFICE - LATER**

The celebration is in full swing. Laughter and MUSIC fill the room. Suddenly, ALEX’s screen flashes with an ENCRYPTED MESSAGE.

**ALEX**  
(frowning)  
What the...?

He squints at the screen, slowly cracking the code.

**ALEX**  
(to himself)  
"You are all complicit in a murder. It’s time for justice. You will die, one by one."

**ALEX'S POV**  
The cheerful atmosphere contrasts with the chilling message. 

**JAMIE**  
(leaning in)  
What’s wrong?

**ALEX**  
(trying to dismiss it)  
Just a weird error message.

**INT. BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

ALEX walks into the break room. He stops in his tracks—JAMIE lies on the floor, lifeless.

**ALEX**  
(shouting)  
Oh my god! Jamie!

The others rush in, PANICKING.

**LENA**  
(screaming)  
What happened?!

**SOPHIA**  
(gasps)  
Is she dead?

**MAX**  
(looking around)  
Someone call 911!

**ETHAN**  
(terrified)  
This can’t be happening!

**ALEX**  
(whispers)  
The message... it was real.

**INT. OFFICE - LATER**

The group gathers, tension thick in the air. ALEX stands in front of them, shaking.

**ALEX**  
Someone sent that message. We’re not safe here.

**TINA**  
(panicked)  
This is a joke, right? Jamie’s just playing dead!

**DAVID**  
(shaking his head)  
No! Look at her!

**ETHAN**  
(frantic)  
What do we do now? 

**ALEX**  
We need to figure out who did this.

**LENA**  
What about the message? It said we’re all complicit.

**MAX**  
(leaning in)  
What does that even mean?

**ALEX**  
I think it ties to something each of us has done...

**INT. OFFICE - LATER**

The group sits around the table, tension palpable. ALEX types on his computer, revealing another ENCRYPTED MESSAGE.

**ALEX**  
(reading)  
"The one who backstabbed."

**SOPHIA**  
(whispers)  
That sounds like Jamie...

**TINA**  
(suspiciously)  
What did she do?

**ALEX**  
She sabotaged the project... framed me.

**LENA**  
(eyes widening)  
We all thought it was a mistake.

The group goes SILENT. 

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

The atmosphere is heavy. LENA sips her coffee, then suddenly coughs violently, clutching her throat.

**LENA**  
(gasping)  
Help me!

**MAX**  
(shouting)  
What’s happening?!

She collapses. 

**SOPHIA**  
(screaming)  
No!

**ALEX**  
(frantic)  
What did you do, Lena?

**TINA**  
(realization dawning)  
The message! "The one who buried the truth."

**ALEX**  
(eyes wide)  
The data breach!

**ETHAN**  
(panicking)  
This can’t be real!

**INT. OFFICE - LATER**

ALEX is at the computer, unlocking another ENCRYPTED MESSAGE.

**ALEX**  
(reading)  
"The one who set fire to their past."

**MAX**  
What does that mean?

**ALEX**  
You set fire to the old office! 

**MAX**  
(defensive)  
To cover up my mistakes! It was an accident!

**SOPHIA**  
(stepping back)  
We’re all going to die, aren’t we?

The lights FLICKER. 

**INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER**

The group is on edge. ALEX’s computer beeps. Another ENCRYPTED MESSAGE appears.

**ALEX**  
(reading)  
"The one who controlled with fear."

**SOPHIA**  
(fuming)  
That’s me! I blackmailed the CEO!

**TINA**  
You deserve whatever comes next!

**SOPHIA**  
(furious)  
Shut up! You’re all hiding your sins!

**INT. OFFICE - LATER**

ALEX types again. Another message appears.

**ALEX**  
(reading)  
"The one who forged their future."

**ETHAN**  
(sweating)  
I didn’t mean to!

**ALEX**  
You faked the financials!

ETHAN stares, fear in his eyes.

**INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER**

TINA opens a drawer, revealing a VIAL OF POISON.

**TINA**  
(defensively)  
I was just... 

**ALEX**  
(realizing)  
You poisoned someone, didn’t you?

**TINA**  
(pleading)  
It was never supposed to go this far!

**INT. SERVER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

ALEX types again. Another message appears.

**ALEX**  
(reading)  
"The one who sold their soul."

**DAVID**  
(terrified)  
I hacked the database! I had to!

**MAX**  
(angry)  
You’re all guilty!

**INT. OFFICE - LATER**

ALEX stands in front of his computer, trembling as he types.

**ALEX**  
(reading)  
"The one who manipulated all."

**SOPHIA**  
(stunned)  
What does that mean?

**ALEX**  
(realizing)  
I... I orchestrated it all.

**LENA**  
(shocked)  
You set us up?!

**ALEX**  
(fighting tears)  
I thought... I thought it was justice. 

**INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER**

ALEX’s hands shake as he types one last message.

**ALEX**  
(typing)  
"I have eradicated their sins. It is done."

The lights flicker one last time. Suddenly—BLACKOUT.

**INT. OFFICE - LATER**

The room is silent. The sound of DISTANT SIRENS can be heard. 

**FADE OUT.**
