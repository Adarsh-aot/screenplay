Scene 2 (Expanded)
INT. OFFICE - BREAK ROOM - EARLY NIGHT

The group is in high spirits, laughing and clinking their glasses. A tacky Christmas playlist plays in the background. CO-WORKER 1 and CO-WORKER 2 are stringing up lights, debating over their placement.

CO-WORKER 1
(laughing)
No, no—higher! It looks like Santa himself got tangled in those.

CO-WORKER 2
(grinning)
Says the expert decorator. Alright, how about this?

CO-WORKER 3 is balancing precariously on a chair to hang a garland.

CO-WORKER 3
(teasing)
You guys can fight about lights all night, but I’ll have this garland perfect before you’re done.

LENA
(snickering, sipping her drink)
Yeah, right. Last year you stapled one to the wall.

CO-WORKER 3
(mock offense)
And it stayed up all season, thank you very much.

In the corner, ALEX is half-heartedly participating, fiddling with his phone. JAMIE approaches him with a glass of champagne.

JAMIE
(cheerfully)
Hey, you’ve been glued to that thing all night. Join the fun!

ALEX
(awkwardly)
Just… checking something. But yeah, I’ll—

Suddenly, CO-WORKER 5 rushes in, looking pale and frantic.

CO-WORKER 5
(breathless)
Guys… guys, you have to come to the break room.

The laughter dies instantly.

CO-WORKER 2
(frowning)
What is it?

CO-WORKER 5
(voice trembling)
It’s Jamie. Something’s… wrong.

The group exchanges uneasy glances before following CO-WORKER 5 to the break room.

INT. OFFICE - BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The door swings open. The festive decorations seem out of place against the horrifying sight of JAMIE lying on the floor, a knife in her back. Her glass of champagne is shattered beside her, the liquid pooling on the tiles.

CO-WORKER 1
(gasping, horrified)
Oh my God! Jamie! Is she…?

CO-WORKER 2
(frozen, then panicking)
Someone call the police!

CO-WORKER 3 kneels hesitantly, checking for a pulse.

CO-WORKER 3
(shaking head, voice breaking)
She’s gone…

ALEX stands frozen, his earlier unease now fully realized. He clears his throat and steps forward.

ALEX
(quietly)
I… I got a message earlier. On my computer.

The group turns to him, confused and fearful.

CO-WORKER 4
(suspiciously)
What kind of message?

ALEX
(hesitant)
It said we’re all complicit in something. And that… justice was coming tonight.

A heavy silence falls.

CO-WORKER 2
(accusatory)
And you didn’t think to tell anyone?

ALEX
(defensive)
I thought it was some sick prank! How was I supposed to know this would happen?

His computer pings loudly, shattering the silence. Everyone looks toward the desk.

INT. OFFICE - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The group rushes back to the main room, huddling around ALEX’S COMPUTER. The screen displays a new encrypted message.

ON ALEX’S COMPUTER SCREEN

"The one who backstabbed to rise higher has paid the price."

CO-WORKER 4
(fearfully)
Jamie… she got her promotion by sabotaging Chris, didn’t she?

CO-WORKER 2
(terrified, whispering)
It’s like someone is… punishing us. For what we’ve done.

CO-WORKER 1
(panicking)
What else do they know? What else have we done?

ALEX
(voice trembling)
Whoever this is… they know everything.
