**Title:** The Christmas Code

---

**Scene 1**

**CO-WORKER 1**


*INT. OFFICE - CHRISTMAS EVE - NIGHT*

The office is adorned with Christmas lights and garlands. Eight colleagues are gathered, enjoying holiday drinks and decorating. **ALEX**, a quiet developer, sits at his computer, watching the others with a small, reserved smile. Suddenly, an alert appears on his screen.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"You are all complicit in a murder. Justice will come tonight."*

**ALEX**  
(whispering to himself)  
What is this…?

He glances around at his colleagues, all still laughing and talking. He shakes his head and goes back to decorating, unnerved.

---

Scene 2 (Expanded)
INT. OFFICE - BREAK ROOM - EARLY NIGHT

The group is in high spirits, laughing and clinking their glasses. A tacky Christmas playlist plays in the background. CO-WORKER 1 and CO-WORKER 2 are stringing up lights, debating over their placement.

CO-WORKER 1
(laughing)
No, no—higher! It looks like Santa himself got tangled in those.

CO-WORKER 2
(grinning)
Says the expert decorator. Alright, how about this?

CO-WORKER 3 is balancing precariously on a chair to hang a garland.

CO-WORKER 3
(teasing)
You guys can fight about lights all night, but I’ll have this garland perfect before you’re done.

LENA
(snickering, sipping her drink)
Yeah, right. Last year you stapled one to the wall.

CO-WORKER 3
(mock offense)
And it stayed up all season, thank you very much.

In the corner, ALEX is half-heartedly participating, fiddling with his phone. JAMIE approaches him with a glass of champagne.

JAMIE
(cheerfully)
Hey, you’ve been glued to that thing all night. Join the fun!

ALEX
(awkwardly)
Just… checking something. But yeah, I’ll—

Suddenly, CO-WORKER 5 rushes in, looking pale and frantic.

CO-WORKER 5
(breathless)
Guys… guys, you have to come to the break room.

The laughter dies instantly.

CO-WORKER 2
(frowning)
What is it?

CO-WORKER 5
(voice trembling)
It’s Jamie. Something’s… wrong.

The group exchanges uneasy glances before following CO-WORKER 5 to the break room.

INT. OFFICE - BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The door swings open. The festive decorations seem out of place against the horrifying sight of JAMIE lying on the floor, a knife in her back. Her glass of champagne is shattered beside her, the liquid pooling on the tiles.

CO-WORKER 1
(gasping, horrified)
Oh my God! Jamie! Is she…?

CO-WORKER 2
(frozen, then panicking)
Someone call the police!

CO-WORKER 3 kneels hesitantly, checking for a pulse.

CO-WORKER 3
(shaking head, voice breaking)
She’s gone…

ALEX stands frozen, his earlier unease now fully realized. He clears his throat and steps forward.

ALEX
(quietly)
I… I got a message earlier. On my computer.

The group turns to him, confused and fearful.

CO-WORKER 4
(suspiciously)
What kind of message?

ALEX
(hesitant)
It said we’re all complicit in something. And that… justice was coming tonight.

A heavy silence falls.

CO-WORKER 2
(accusatory)
And you didn’t think to tell anyone?

ALEX
(defensive)
I thought it was some sick prank! How was I supposed to know this would happen?

His computer pings loudly, shattering the silence. Everyone looks toward the desk.

INT. OFFICE - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The group rushes back to the main room, huddling around ALEX’S COMPUTER. The screen displays a new encrypted message.

ON ALEX’S COMPUTER SCREEN

"The one who backstabbed to rise higher has paid the price."

CO-WORKER 4
(fearfully)
Jamie… she got her promotion by sabotaging Chris, didn’t she?

CO-WORKER 2
(terrified, whispering)
It’s like someone is… punishing us. For what we’ve done.

CO-WORKER 1
(panicking)
What else do they know? What else have we done?

ALEX
(voice trembling)
Whoever this is… they know everything.

### Scene 3 Rewrite: Sarah’s Sin  

---

*INT. OFFICE - MAIN ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT*  

The group is tense, gathered near Alex’s desk. The air is heavy with suspicion and fear. Suddenly, **ALEX’S COMPUTER** lights up with a loud **PING**. Everyone jumps, their eyes darting toward the screen.  

**ALEX**  
(uneasy)  
It’s… another message.  

The group crowds around as Alex opens it, their faces illuminated by the eerie glow of the monitor.  

**ON ALEX’S COMPUTER SCREEN**  
*"The poisoner will sip their own malice. Justice is served tonight."*  

A chilling silence grips the room as the words sink in.  

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(whispering)  
Poisoner? What does that mean?  

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(agitated)  
Who here could that be about?  

All eyes shift uneasily. Sarah shifts uncomfortably, avoiding their gazes.  

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(suspiciously, pointing at Sarah)  
Sarah, you’ve been awfully quiet.  

**SARAH**  
(defensive, snapping)  
Why are you looking at me? I didn’t do anything!  

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(pressing)  
Didn’t you? What about Emily last year? That coffee you gave her?  

**SARAH**  
(angrily)  
That wasn’t poison! It was just bad coffee—she overreacted!  

**ALEX**  
(cutting in, darkly)  
She was hospitalized, Sarah.  

Sarah glares at Alex, her face hardening.  

**SARAH**  
(spiteful)  
You all act so high and mighty. But you’d do the same in my position.  

The group stares in disbelief.  

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(quietly)  
No, Sarah… we wouldn’t.  

The tension snaps as Sarah storms out of the room, leaving behind an uneasy silence.  

---

*INT. OFFICE - KITCHEN AREA - MOMENTS LATER*  

Sarah paces the small kitchen, her mind racing.  

**SARAH**  
(to herself, muttering)  
This is ridiculous. They’re trying to scare me. That’s all it is.  

She grabs a glass from the counter, fills it with water, and gulps it down, her hands trembling.  

As she sets the glass down, her eyes fall on a small, neatly wrapped package sitting conspicuously on the counter. A single note is taped to it.  

**NOTE**  
*"A taste of your own malice."*  

Her breath catches in her throat. She stares at the package, paralyzed.  

**SARAH**  
(whispering)  
No… this can’t be happening.  

Suddenly, she clutches her stomach, her face contorted in agony.  

**SARAH**  
(panicking)  
Help… someone…  

Her legs buckle, and she collapses to the floor. Her body convulses before falling completely still, the sound of her glass shattering echoing in the empty kitchen.  

---

*INT. OFFICE - MAIN ROOM - MINUTES LATER*  

The group hears the crash and Sarah’s muffled cry. They rush to the kitchen, finding Sarah’s lifeless body sprawled on the floor, her glass broken beside her.  

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(horrified, trembling)  
Oh my God… Sarah…  

**ALEX**  
(looking down at her body, his voice low)  
The message wasn’t just a warning.  

---  


**Scene 4**

*INT. OFFICE - LATER*

The remaining survivors sit in tense silence, their eyes darting around the room. **CO-WORKER 3** suddenly speaks up.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(angry, on edge)  
Alright, who’s behind this? Who’s sending these messages?

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(pointing at Alex)  
It has to be him! He’s the one getting the messages!

**ALEX**  
(defensive)  
Why would I be orchestrating all of this? I’m just as scared as you!

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(desperately)  
There has to be a way out of this. If we just stay calm—

The computer pings again. Everyone freezes.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The fire that hid the truth will consume the liar."*

**CO-WORKER 4**  
(turning to MAX)  
Max… you set that fire at the old office, didn’t you?

**MAX**  
(defensive)  
So what? I needed to cover up some things. I never thought it would come back to me!

Suddenly, smoke starts seeping in from the room next door. Max’s eyes widen in horror.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(screaming)  
Max! Get out of there!

Max stumbles, coughing, but collapses before he can escape. The group rushes in, only to find him dead, the room filled with smoke and charred documents.

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(stammering)  
It… it’s real. This is all real.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(sobbing)  
We’re trapped… we’re going to die here!

**ALEX**  
(breathing heavily)  
Someone’s making us pay for everything we’ve done. Nothing we’ve buried is staying buried.

---

**Scene 5**

*INT. OFFICE - LATER STILL*

The survivors gather in the center of the room, all on edge. **CO-WORKER 3** turns to the group.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(sobbing)  
Who could possibly know all of this? Who could be doing this?

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(sneering at Alex)  
Maybe Alex. He’s the one with the messages.

**ALEX**  
(frustrated)  
I told you—I don’t know who’s behind this! But we have to stay together if we’re going to survive.

Another ping interrupts him. Everyone tenses up.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The voice that whispered threats will be silenced."*

**CO-WORKER 4**  
(glancing nervously at SOPHIA)  
Sophia… you blackmailed the CEO, didn’t you?

**SOPHIA**  
(defensive)  
Maybe I did, but so what? It’s not like I killed anyone!

Suddenly, she gasps, clutching her throat. She collapses to the ground, her voice silenced forever.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(hysterical)  
This… this isn’t happening. It’s like something out of a nightmare!

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(turning to Alex, accusing)  
I still think you know more than you’re letting on, Alex.

**ALEX**  
(shouting)  
I don’t! Whoever’s doing this has a plan, and we’re all just… pawns.

Here’s the revised **Scene 6** with the cause of death changed to a more dramatic sequence where the victim, Ethan, dies after being pushed during a flickering light, falling on an iron beam. I’ve also added more conversation to heighten the tension and build suspense:

---

**Scene 6**

*INT. OFFICE - NEARING MIDNIGHT*

The remaining survivors stand around the room, their eyes darting nervously between each other. The festive decorations are still hanging, but their once-vibrant colors now seem foreboding in the dim light. The laughter of a few hours ago is now replaced with fearful whispers and mistrust.

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(whispering, glancing at the others)  
It’s happening again… one by one. We can’t keep waiting like this.

**ALEX**  
(focused, staring at his computer screen)  
We need to understand the messages. They’re clues, they’re all we have.

The screen flickers again, and a new message pops up in the corner of Alex’s computer. It’s encrypted and strange, like a cryptic riddle that holds the key to everything.

**ON ALEX’S COMPUTER SCREEN**  

Encrypted message: *“Wife blind to rings, threads entwined; countless ties concealed in shadows”*

The room falls silent. Everyone stares at the screen, trying to process the meaning.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(staring at the screen in disbelief)  
That’s… that’s about Ethan. He’s been hiding it all this time… all those women, all the affairs. His wife, his life, they were all lies.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(voice rising)  
How could he do that? How could he betray everyone? And no one even knew!

**ETHAN**  
(defensively, his voice shaky)  
I didn’t mean to hurt anyone! It wasn’t like that! You don’t understand!

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(stepping forward, angrily)  
No, we *understand* perfectly, Ethan. You’ve been playing everyone! Your wife, us—no one was safe from your lies!

Suddenly, the lights flicker.

The entire room goes dark for a brief second, and then the lights flash back on.

**ETHAN**  
(eyes wide, frantic)  
What the hell? What’s going on? Is this some sort of joke?

In the brief moment when the lights flicker, **someone**—it’s unclear who—*pushes* Ethan. He stumbles backward in a panicked attempt to regain his balance.

His foot catches on the leg of a nearby chair. With a loud *crash*, he falls backward, his body hurtling toward a sharp, jagged **iron beam** jutting from the floor near the support pillars of the room. The impact is brutal. Ethan’s scream is drowned out as the beam pierces his side with a sickening crunch.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(screaming)  
Ethan!

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(pulling away, horrified)  
He… he’s dead. Oh God, he’s dead!

Blood spills from Ethan’s body as he lies twisted on the floor. His eyes are wide open, but they are already lifeless.

**ETHAN**  
(weakly, gasping)  
I… I didn’t mean to… hurt anyone… I… I was trapped, too…

As his words fade away, a heavy silence falls over the group. The lights flicker again, casting eerie shadows across the room. 

**ALEX**  
(eyes wide, staring at Ethan’s body)  
This is it… the curse, the punishment for everything he’s done. It’s not just a coincidence anymore. 

**CO-WORKER 2**  
(voice shaking, near tears)  
We’re next, aren’t we? Whoever’s behind this… they’re picking us off one by one. Each of us has something to pay for.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(panicking)  
We need to get out of here! We can’t wait any longer. Please, we have to leave before—

Suddenly, the lights flicker again, and the eerie hum of the dying bulbs fills the air. The shadows cast on the walls grow long and threatening.

**ALEX**  
(staring at the door, motioning to the others)  
It’s no use. It’s already too late. Whoever’s doing this… they know exactly where we are. They’re watching us.

A tense silence follows, as they all process the gravity of their situation.

**CO-WORKER 3**  
(quietly, her voice trembling)  
Then we’re not just trapped in this room. We’re trapped in this nightmare.

The group stands together, fear evident in their faces as they realize they are stuck, with nowhere to hide, nowhere to run. The haunting reminder of Ethan’s brutal death hangs over them like a dark cloud.

**Scene 7**

*INT. OFFICE - PRE-DAWN HOURS*

Only Alex and **CO-WORKER 1** remain in the office, the silence between them heavy. The tension is palpable as they exchange uneasy glances.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(nervously)  
I don't know, Alex... you're the only one left. Could you really be behind all of this? 

**ALEX**  
(sighs, with a dark chuckle)  
If I were behind it all, wouldn’t I have spared myself? Wouldn’t I have set things up better?

A sudden ping interrupts the uneasy silence. Both of them jump.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The mask of kindness hides a heart of venom."*

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(turning, looking at Tina with suspicion)  
Tina... You were the one who always made others feel small, weren't you? You manipulated people, bullied them so you could get ahead, and then you just quit when things got tough. You never cared, did you?

**TINA**  
(panicked, trying to defend herself)  
What? No, that's not what happened! I didn’t mean to hurt anyone! I was just... I was just trying to survive. They always picked on me, made me feel like I wasn’t enough. I had to do something! 

**ALEX**  
(quietly, with growing disgust)  
You thought you could get away with it, Tina. Pretending to be everyone's friend, then turning your back when they needed you. You pushed people around, made their lives miserable just so you could leave without looking back. And now, look at us—stuck here, paying the price.

**TINA**  
(voice trembling)  
It wasn’t like that! I— 

**ALEX**  
(interrupting, his voice dark)  
You pushed everyone away, abandoned your coworkers, and walked out when it suited you. You left us to clean up your mess. But you thought you could hide behind that smile, that "kind" facade. All of it was a lie.

Tina stares at the screen, her eyes widening in horror. She stumbles back, visibly shaking.

**TINA**  
(voice breaking)  
I didn't... I didn't mean to... but I couldn’t stay. They were always on my back, bullying me, telling me I wasn’t good enough. I just wanted to leave, to get away from it all...

**ALEX**  
(shaking his head, disgusted)  
Leaving doesn’t make you innocent, Tina. You took the easy way out, abandoned everyone who counted on you, and now, you’re getting what you deserve.

Tina, trembling, reaches for her coffee cup with a shaky hand. She takes a sip, her eyes glued to the screen. A few moments later, her body goes rigid. Her breathing becomes shallow, and she falls to her knees, gasping for air.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(crying, horrified)  
Tina! What did you do?

Tina collapses onto the floor, her body twitching uncontrollably. Her face twists in pain before she falls motionless.

**ALEX**  
(softly, with a bitter tone)  
You thought you could escape the consequences, Tina. But you can’t run forever. The mask of kindness hides the poison in the heart.

**CO-WORKER 1**  
(staring, shaking)  
What’s happening here? Are we... are we all going to die?

**ALEX**  
(somberly)  
It’s a twisted form of justice. Everyone’s past catches up to them. No one gets away clean.

---


**Scene 8**

*INT. OFFICE - DAWN*

Only Alex remains. The final message appears.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

Encrypted message: *"The mastermind who played the victim now watches his work come to light."*

Alex smirks, his eyes darkening.

**ALEX**  
(quietly, to himself)  
They’ve paid for their sins. Justice is served.

He types one last message into his computer.

**ON ALEX'S COMPUTER SCREEN**

*They have paid for their crimes. Justice is served. The circle is complete.*

As the police arrive, they find Alex lifeless at his desk, his final message illuminating the screen.

**FADE OUT.**
