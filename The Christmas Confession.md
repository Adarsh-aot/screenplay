**Scene 1 - Arrival and First Impressions**

Ten contestants gather in the dim lobby, eyeing each other suspiciously.

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
Welcome to *The Last Broadcast*. For each truth revealed, you move one step closer to the prize...and survival.

**LIAM**  
(skeptical)  
Looks like just another reality show gimmick to me.

**JAVIER**  
You think it's a joke? No one's even here to film us.

**MEGAN**  
(smirking)  
Maybe the cameras are hidden. You’d know that, wouldn’t you, Liam?

**DAVID**  
Calm down. Let's just figure out what they want.

**FELIX**  
(whispering, paranoid)  
They're watching us. This whole thing is a trap.

**ETHAN**  
Let's not start with the conspiracies, Felix.

**MILES**  
(cutting in)  
Why not? Adds a little spice to the story, doesn’t it?

**CALVIN**  
(uncomfortable)  
This isn’t right. There’s something…off about this place.

**JORDAN**  
(offbeat)  
I like it. Feels...raw.

**EMILY**  
(calmly)  
Focus. The voice mentioned "truth." We need to play along until we know more.

### Scene 2 - The Truth Room

The contestants enter a dark room with a chair in the middle, marked "TRUTH ROOM."

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
Who will reveal the first truth?

**MEGAN**  
(sarcastic)  
How about you, priest? Got anything to confess?

**CALVIN**  
(tense)  
I didn’t come here to bare my soul.

**ETHAN**  
(to Calvin)  
So you’re hiding something, too.

**FELIX**  
(grinning)  
Of course, he is. We all are.

**LIAM**  
(dismissive)  
Fine. I’ll go. (sighs) Embezzlement. Just a little "financial misstep" in my career.

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
(ominous)  
Good, Liam. But the truth has its price.

Suddenly, the chair emits a bright flash, jolting **Liam**.

**JAVIER**  
(shocked)  
What the hell was that?

**EMILY**  
(calmly analyzing)  
They want us to hurt each other with the truth.

### Scene 3 - Alliances Form

Tension rises as alliances begin to form. **Megan** approaches **Ethan**.

**MEGAN**  
(low voice)  
We need a plan. Stick together.

**ETHAN**  
(skeptical)  
And why should I trust you?

**MEGAN**  
You’re an ex-cop. Think about it.

**DAVID**  
(overhearing)  
Or we can all try to get out alive.

**LIAM**  
(scoffs)  
Good luck with that.

**FELIX**  
(glaring)  
I don’t trust any of you.

**MILES**  
(to Felix)  
You wouldn’t. You’re always paranoid.

**CALVIN**  
This isn’t the time to argue. We need a way out.

**EMILY**  
(studying them)  
You’re all missing the point. We’re here to face our demons.

**JORDAN**  
(laughs)  
Then why not start now?

---

### Scene 4 - The Second Challenge

The contestants gather, nervous, as the **VOICE** announces another challenge.

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
Reveal the truth about your greatest betrayal.

**ETHAN**  
(sighing)  
I… set up an innocent man once. Just to close a case.

**MILES**  
(smirking)  
Not so heroic now, are you, detective?

**JAVIER**  
(bitterly)  
We all did things. You think you’re better?

**MEGAN**  
(to everyone)  
This game isn’t about winning; it’s about survival.

**DAVID**  
But at what cost?

**FELIX**  
(in a frenzy)  
This is punishment. We’re not meant to leave here.

**LIAM**  
Then why’d they offer a prize?

**CALVIN**  
Maybe the prize is to test us. See if we’ll betray each other.

**EMILY**  
(somber)  
Maybe only one of us can leave.

---

### Scene 5 - The Betrayal Room

Each contestant stands before an image of a victim from their past.

**JAVIER**  
(in agony)  
I didn’t mean for it to happen...

**MILES**  
(scoffing)  
Spare us the sob story.

**CALVIN**  
This is sick. Making us relive our sins.

**DAVID**  
Maybe we deserve it.

**ETHAN**  
Or maybe we fight back.

**LIAM**  
Oh, now you want to play hero?

**FELIX**  
(shouting)  
This is all a setup!

**MEGAN**  
(to Felix)  
Quiet! They’re listening.

**EMILY**  
It’s not just about listening. They want us to break.

---

### Scene 6 - The Accusations

Mistrust grows, and the group begins turning on each other.

**ETHAN**  
I know someone here is a plant. A mole.

**MEGAN**  
(accusing)  
Probably you, Mr. Detective.

**LIAM**  
Or maybe it’s you, hacker girl.

**DAVID**  
(trying to calm them)  
We’re not going to survive this way.

**JORDAN**  
(cackling)  
Survival? No one’s getting out.

**CALVIN**  
This is hell. Our own sins, coming back.

**FELIX**  
(screaming)  
They’ll kill us all!

**EMILY**  
Stay calm. We can’t let them divide us.

---

### Scene 7 - Attempted Escape

The contestants find a locked door labeled "EXIT."

**MEGAN**  
(frustrated)  
It’s jammed. We need a code.

**DAVID**  
What if the clues are in the challenges?

**JAVIER**  
Or maybe it’s a trap.

**ETHAN**  
(to Megan)  
Can you hack it?

**MEGAN**  
(sighs)  
I’ll try.

**FELIX**  
(desperate)  
They won’t let us leave!

**LIAM**  
Then let’s break it down.

**CALVIN**  
We’ll only alert them.

**JORDAN**  
(whispering)  
They already know.

---

### Scene 8 - The Code Challenge

They discover a set of clues that could unlock the door, but only if they reveal more secrets.

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
For each truth, a number. The code to freedom.

**EMILY**  
(whispering)  
It’s a trick.

**MEGAN**  
(sighing)  
But we’re out of options.

**DAVID**  
Fine. I stole from people who trusted me.

**JAVIER**  
(whispering)  
I left someone to die.

**MILES**  
(to Emily)  
You’re next, Doc.

**ETHAN**  
Enough. Let’s get this over with.

**CALVIN**  
I can’t believe we’re doing this.

---

### Scene 9 - The Final Revelation

The last two contestants, **Megan** and **David**, reach the final room.

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
Only one may leave. Reveal the ultimate truth… or perish together.

**MEGAN**  
(teary)  
David, there’s no way out.

**DAVID**  
(somberly)  
Maybe there never was.

**MEGAN**  
Then why go through all this?

**DAVID**  
(sighs)  
Because sometimes… the truth isn’t enough.

**MEGAN**  
I can’t do this.

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
Time is running out.

**DAVID**  
(screaming)  
We’re done playing!

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
Then face your end.

---

### Scene 10 - The Escape

Suddenly, a crack in the wall reveals an emergency exit. **Megan** and **David** bolt for it.

**VOICE (O.S.)**  
No one leaves without paying the price.

**MEGAN**  
(breathless)  
Run! Don’t look back!

**DAVID**  
(panicked)  
They’re still watching!

**MEGAN**  
It doesn’t matter—just GO!

**SOUND OF ALARMS** blare as they race through the hidden passage, dodging traps.

**DAVID**  
(shouting over alarms)  
We’re almost there!

**MEGAN**  
(screaming)  
This way!

They reach the final door, burst through it, and stumble into the cold dawn, haunted by the horrific ordeal they’ve endured.

**FADE OUT.**
